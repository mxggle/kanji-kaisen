## Origin

The maiashi radical is a pictograph of two feet pointed in opposite directions. It represents a fundamental lack of coordination, a physical disagreement, or a state of literal "conflict" between directions.

## Story

Walking in opposite directions! This radical captures the dynamic tension of a path that splits or two feet that simply won't move together. When you see it, think of contradictions, the complex coordination of dancing (where feet move in intricate, opposing patterns), and the physical act of being mismatched. It brings a sense of active tension and "opposing" energy to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/right of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical coordination (dancing), mistakes and conflicts (pointing the wrong way), or the state of being opposite or mismatched.

### 舜 (shun - ancient sage king)
