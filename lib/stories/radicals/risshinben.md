## Origin

The risshinben radical is the compressed, "standing" form of the "heart" (心) radical. It represents the human heart and the emotions that pulse from it, narrowed to fit on the left side. The vertical stroke is the core of the heart, with the side strokes representing its rhythmic beating.

## Story

Feel the beat! When the heart "stands up" on the left side of a kanji, it brings the intense energy of emotion and thought. It is the radical of how we feel—our joy, our hate, our busy minds, and our quiet feelings. When you see it, think of the pulse of your own spirit driving every action you take.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates emotions, mental states, temperament, thoughts, feelings, and the inner workings of the human spirit.
