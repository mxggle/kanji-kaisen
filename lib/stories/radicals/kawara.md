## Origin

The kawara radical is a pictograph of a ceramic roof tile or a simple pottery vessel. It represents materials made of baked clay and, in modern scientific contexts, serves as the symbol for the unit of weight, the "gram."

## Story

Set the tiles! This radical brings the durability and the careful craftsmanship of ceramic work to its characters. When you see it, think of baked earth, sturdy roof tiles that weather the storm, large pottery jars, and the precise measurements of physical weight. It is the radical of the master potter, the tireless roof-worker, and the lab technician measuring the world.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/right of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning
