## Origin

The ya radical is a literal pictograph of an arrow. The top part is the pointed arrowhead, the horizontal stroke represents the fletching (feathers), and the central vertical line is the shaft. It captures the essence of a weapon that travels in a straight, direct line.

## Story

Straight as an arrow! Imagine a wooden arrow notched into a bow, ready to fly toward its target. This radical represents "directness," "speed," and the "decisive" nature of finding an answer. When you see it, think of the power of a single, sharp retort and the focused knowledge that "knows" exactly where to strike.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears on the left side of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates arrows, distance (bow-shot), speed, directness, decisiveness, or concepts related to knowing (direct knowledge) and health (shot with an arrow).

## Example Kanji

### 矢 (arrow)

The base kanji for an arrow, a symbol of directness and traditional weaponry used in battle and hunting.

### 知 (know)

Arrow (矢) + mouth (口). To have knowledge that is as "direct" and "decisive" as an "arrow" leaving the moth—the literal act of "knowing."

### 短 (short)

Arrow (矢) + bean/vessel (豆). Originally suggested a "short" distance, like the length of an "arrow" compared to a long "vessel"—the opposite of long.
