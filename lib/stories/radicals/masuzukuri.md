## Origin

The masuzukuri radical is a pictograph of a long-handled ladle or a specific "to" (measuring cup) used for scooping grain or liquids. It is also the iconic shape of the "Big Dipper" constellation (Hokuto).

## Story

Measure it exactly! This radical represents the tools of calculation and the vast, spanning scale of the star-filled sky. When you see it, think of ladles, precise units of measurement, and the action of scooping or pouring with intent. It brings a sense of grounded precision, careful evaluation, and the cosmic order of the night sky to every character it joins.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates measurements of volume (ladles, cups), the act of scooping or pouring, diagonal/slanted motions, or the stars and constellations.

## Example Kanji

### 料 (fee / material / ingredients)

Rice (米) + measure/ladle (斗). To carefully "measure" a specific quantity of raw "rice" with a ladle—representing the cost, fee, or the raw "material."

### 斜 (diagonal / slanted / slanting)

Surplus/excess (余) + measure/ladle (斗). Imagine pouring a liquid from a "ladle" at an "excessive" angle—causing it to flow in a "diagonal" direction.

### 斗 (measuring cup / Big Dipper)

The base radical, representing an ancient unit of volume and the most famous constellation in the northern sky.
