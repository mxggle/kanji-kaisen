The keigamae radical is a pictograph of a fenced enclosure or the ancient borders of a city. it represents the physical and conceptual lines that define a space or a territory.

## Story

Keep it within the borders! This radical represents the lines that separate what is "inside" from what is "outside." When you see it wrapping around a character, think of limits, town borders, and the defined areas where life and community happen. It brings a sense of structure, containment, and geographical definition to any character it joins.

## Position

Wraps around the central component of the kanji from the top and sides (an open-bottom box).

## Transforms Meaning
