## Origin

A detailed pictograph of a traditional large gate with two swinging doors. You can see the two door panels on either side and the frame that holds them together.

## Story

Imagine the grand entrance to a temple or a fortress! Two heavy wooden doors stand ready to swing wide. This radical encloses other elements just like a doorway frames the world beyond it. It is the sign of transitions, openings, and the boundaries between inside and out.

## Position

Surrounds other elements, acting like a frame around the center of the kanji

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates gates, doorways, openings, or concepts related to moving between spaces or being between things

## Example Kanji

### 開 (open)

Gate radical + hands moving a bolt = the act of swinging the two heavy leaves of a gate open.

### 閉 (close / shut)

Gate radical + a bar or someone inside = the act of pulling the doors together and barring them for the night.

### 間 (between / space / time)

Gate radical + sun (日) = imagine the golden sunlight shining through the tiny gap between the two closed doors of a gate.
