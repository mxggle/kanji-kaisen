## Origin

The sato radical is a combination of "rice field" (田) and "earth" (土). It originally depicted a settlement or a community of homes built on the ground near the fields—the fundamental unit of a "village." It also became a standard unit of distance, representing the length of a typical village.

## Story

Home is where the fields are! Imagine a cluster of small houses surrounded by rich soil and green crops. This radical represents the heart of rural life and the organized measurement of the landscape. When you see it, think of a community, a hometown, or a long journey through the countryside.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears at the bottom or left side of a character.
