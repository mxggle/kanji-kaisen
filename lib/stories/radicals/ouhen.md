## Origin

The ouhen radical is identical in shape to the kanji for "king" (王), but when used as a radical on the left side, it actually represents "jewelry" or "precious jade" (玉). It is a pictograph of three pieces of jade strung together on a cord, a symbol of extreme wealth and status.

## Story

A treasure for royalty! While it looks like a "king," the true soul of this radical is "jade." When you see it on the left side of a kanji, imagine the shimmering glow of a precious gem or the clinking of a necklace. It brings a sense of value, beauty, and the "jeweled" quality of anything rare and important.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates gemstones (especially jade), jewelry, precious objects, beauty, clarity, and things associated with royalty and high status.

## Example Kanji

### 班 (group / squad)

Jewel (王) + sword (刂) + Jewel (王). To take a large "jewel" and use a "sword" to split it into two equal "groups" or halves.

### 現 (present / appear)

Jewel (王) + See (見). A hidden "jewel" that is suddenly brought out into the light so that everyone can "see" it—to appear or be present.

### 理 (reason / logic)

Jewel (王) + Village/order (里). To follow the natural "veins" and "order" inside a rough "jewel" to reveal its true shape—the essence of logic and reason.
