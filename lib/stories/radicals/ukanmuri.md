## Origin

The ukanmuri radical is a pictograph of a roof with a chimney or a top ornament. The vertical dot at the top is the chimney, and the outer frame represents the overhanging eaves of a traditional home. It is the defining symbol of shelter and domestic life.

## Story

Under one roof! Imagine the safety and warmth of a sturdy house at the end of a long day. This radical brings the energy of "home" to every kanji it crowns. When you see it at the top, think of the rooms where we live, the "wealth" we store inside, and the "security" of having a place to call our own.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates houses, buildings, rooms, shelter, protection, domestic affairs, or concepts related to stability, wealth, and residence.

## Example Kanji

### 富 (rich / wealth)

Roof (宀) + full jar (畐). A "house" where the storage jars are completely full—the literal image of "wealth" and prosperity.

### 案 (plan / idea / desk)

Roof (宀) + woman + tree (木). Originally suggested a "desk" (tree) inside a "house" where one sits to think and create a "plan."

### 宅 (home / residence)

Roof (宀) + movement/bottom. The place where you come to rest at the end of your journey—your private "home" or residence.
