## Origin

The kegawa radical is a pictograph of a human hand (the bottom part) actively peeling the skin or "hide" from an animal (the top part). it represents the outer layer of any living, organic thing.

## Story

Peel it back! This radical represents the protective surface of our world—the skin on our bodies, the thick hide of a beast, and even the rough bark of a tree. When you see it, think of protection, organic layers, leatherwork, and the superficial beauty of the surface. It is the radical of the master tanner, the skilled surgeon, and the sharp-tongued wit who cuts through the "skin" to find the truth.
