## Origin

The hana radical is a pictograph of a person's nose. The top part (自) means "self" (capturing the way people point to their nose to refer to themselves), and the bottom part represents the air passages and the process of breathing.

## Story

Take a deep breath! This radical is the center of the face and the primary tool for sensing the world's scents. Because of the deep connection between the nose and identity, it often carries meanings related to the "self" and personal experience. It is the radical of the first breath of life and the scent of destiny that guides us forward.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the main component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Relates to the physical nose, the act of breathing or smelling, and by extension, the concept of the "self" or an individual's presence.

## Example Kanji

### 鼻 (nose)

The base kanji for the organ of smell, representing the "self" (自) that breathes in the air of the world.

### 鼾 (snore)

Nose (鼻) + dry/shield (干). The "dry" or rhythmic sound that comes from the "nose" while one is deep in sleep—the literal image of snoring.

### 齆 (stuffed nose / congested)

Nose (鼻) + old man (翁). Describes the muffled sound of a voice when the "nose" is stuffed or congested, as if spoken by a weary old man.
