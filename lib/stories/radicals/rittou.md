## Origin

The rittou radical is the compressed "standing" form of the "knife" (刀) radical. It represents a sharp, double-edged blade or a sword held upright, ready to cut. It was narrowed to two simple vertical strokes to fit neatly on the right side of characters.

## Story

Slice through it! This "standing knife" radical is all about precision and force. Imagine a sharp blade coming down to split something in two. When you see it on the right, think of cutting, dividing, judging, and the decisive action of an edge meeting its mark. It’s the radical of the "separator."

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates cutting, slicing, carving, separating, judging (deciding a cut), or the use of a sharp tool or weapon.
