## Origin

The boku radical represents the cracks that formed on a turtle shell or ox bone when heated in a ritual fire. Ancient diviners would "read" these spontaneous cracks to interpret the will of the gods and predict the future.

## Story

Crack! Under the intense heat of the ritual fire, a secret path is revealed. This tiny two-stroke radical carries the weight of ancient mysteries and the search for answers. When you see it, think of someone trying to peer into the unknown or making a vital choice based on a sign from above.

## Position

Often appears at the top or right side of a kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates divination, predicting the future, asking for a sign, or the concept of a "point" or a specific "mark."
