## Origin

The oikanmuri radical is the shortened "crown" form of the full "old" kanji (老). It is a pictograph of an elderly person with long, wispy hair leaning on a staff. In this radical form, the "person" part is flattened to sit on top of other characters.

## Story

Respect your elders! This radical is the symbol of wisdom, long life, and the authority that comes with age. When you see it at the top of a kanji, imagine a wise old teacher or a grandparent looking down with experience. It brings a sense of tradition and the weight of many years to any character it joins.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates old age, wisdom, long experience, physical aging, or the concept of thinking and consideration (as elders are often sought for advice).

## Example Kanji

### 者 (person)

Old (老) + sun/day (日 variant). While its origins are debated, it depicts a "wise" person (elder) who has seen many "days"—now used as a general suffix for a person.

### 考 (think / consider)

Old (老) + a breath/effort. To use the wisdom of "age" to "consider" a problem deeply; the act of thinking that leads to a mature decision.

### 孝 (filial piety)

Old (老) + child (子). A beautiful symbol of a "child" supporting an "elder"—the core virtue of respecting and caring for one's parents.
