## Origin

The inoko radical is a detailed pictograph of a pig or a wild boar. It clearly shows the animal's snout, its bristly back, its stout body, and its four legs, capturing the essence of an animal central to agricultural life.

## Story

Oink! This radical is all about the sturdy, valuable animals that have lived alongside humans for thousands of years. In ancient times, a pig was a major symbol of family wealth and abundance. When you see it, think of livestock, prosperity, and the earthy quality of a family farm. It brings a sense of grounded wealth and domestic contentment to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates pigs, wild boars, general livestock, wealth and prosperity (the pig in the house), or the physical flesh and status of an animal.

## Example Kanji

### 家 (house / home / family)

A roof (宀) + a pig (豕). In ancient times, a "house" wasn't considered a true "home" of prosperity unless there was a valuable "pig" living under the "roof."

### 豚 (pig / pork / hog)

Flesh (肉/月) + pig (豕). The literal definition of the "flesh" of a "pig"—representing either the living animal or the meat (pork) it provides.

### 毅 (fortitude / strong / firm)

Stand (立) + pig (豕) + strike (攵). Imagine a "wild boar" that "stands" its ground and "strikes" back with incredible "fortitude" and unyielding strength.
