## Origin

A compressed version of the 貝 (shell) kanji. It remains a detailed pictograph of a cowry shell, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of characters that involve transaction, value, and the movement of wealth.

## Story

Strike a deal in the market! This radical represents the practical, active side of wealth—spending, earning, and the daily rhythm of commerce. When it sits on the left, it tells you that the meaning involves money, business negotiations, or the specific "worth" we place on our goods and efforts. It is the radical of the merchant, the investor, and the treasurer.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates money, business transactions, marketing and trade, saving for the future, or the act of bestowing gifts and value.

## Example Kanji

### 貯 (save / store / lay up)

### 販 (marketing / sell / trade)

Shell/money (貝) + reverse/return (反). Originally related to the "return" and exchange of "shells" in the marketplace—the essence of modern marketing.

### 贈 (gift / present / bestow)
