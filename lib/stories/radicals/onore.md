## Origin

The onore radical is a pictograph of a coiled rope or a bent thread, suggesting something that is personal and focused inward. It eventually evolved to represent the "self" or one's own identity, as if tracing the shape of one's own personal boundaries.

## Story

Focus on yourself! Imagine a line that curves and bends until it points right back at you. This radical represents the individual, the ego, and the inner life of a person. When you see it, think of self-reflection, personal identity, and the things that belong uniquely to "me."

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/right of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the self, one's own person, personal boundaries, or the concept of winding and coiling (reflecting its original rope pictograph).

## Example Kanji

### 己 (self)

The base kanji for one's self, used to emphasize personal identity and the concept of "I" in a formal or humble sense.

### 巻 (roll up / volume)

Self (己) + two hands + cloth. To take a "self-contained" piece of cloth or paper and "roll it up" with two hands to create a scroll or volume.

### 改 (reform / change)

Self (己) + strike (攵). To take a stick and "strike" one's own "self" to improve habits—the literal act of reforming and changing for the better.
