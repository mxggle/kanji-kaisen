## Origin

The no radical is one of the most fundamental building blocks of Japanese writing. It is a single, elegant diagonal stroke that sweeps from the top-right down to the bottom-left. It originally suggested a curved line, such as a blade of grass or a falling leaf.

## Story

Swoosh! Imagine a single stroke of a brush sweeping across the page like a falling leaf or a gust of wind. This radical is the spirit of movement and direction. When you see it, think of a curve, a change in path, or a single mark that defines the flow of a character. It's the radical of the "sweep."

## Position

Often appears as a central or top component in various characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates movement, direction, a curved path, or acts as a foundational structural element that guides the flow of the kanji.
