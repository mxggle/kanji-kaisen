## Origin

The oogai radical is a pictograph of a human head, specifically showing the face, eyes, and the crown of the head. It originally represented a person's countenance or the physical head, eventually evolving to mean a "page" because pages in a book were seen as the "heads" or "faces" of the scroll.

## Story

Face the world! This radical represents everything that happens from the neck up—thinking, seeing, breathing, and the very identity of a person. When you see these strokes, imagine a person's face looking back at you. It is the radical of the mind, the leader, and the primary surface of communication.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the human head, face, neck, thinking processes, leadership, or the physical surface of a page or document.

Colorful/countenance + head (頁). The specific part of the "head" where a person's colorful "expressions" and identity are shown—the face.
