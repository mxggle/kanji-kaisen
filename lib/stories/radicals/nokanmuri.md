## Origin

The nokanmuri radical is the "crown" form of the diagonal sweeping stroke (丿). When it sits on top of a character, it acts as a lid or a directional guide, sweeping across the upper portion of the kanji.

## Story

Sweep across the top! This radical is like a tilted lid or a gust of wind blowing over the rest of the character. It provides the initial motion and sets the direction for the strokes below. When you see it at the very top, think of a sudden movement or a curve that defines the entire character's shape.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates movement from above, a directional shift, or serves as a structural "crown" that flavors the character with a sense of flow.

## Example Kanji

### 乗 (ride / get on)

Sweeping stroke (丿) + a tree (木) + person. Originally depicted a person climbing and "riding" on the top of a wooden structure or tree.

### 移 (move / shift)

Grain (禾) + many (多). While listed here because of its top-left sweep, it shows the "shifting" and "moving" of many grains from one place to another.

### 乏 (scarcity)

Sweeping stroke (丿) at the top of a shape. It suggests something is being "swept" away until there is almost nothing left—the essence of scarcity.
