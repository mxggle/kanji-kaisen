## Origin

The dainomageashi radical is a variation of the "person" radical (大) with one leg bent or twisted. It is a pictograph of a person who is stumbling or has a physical disability that makes their gait uneven.

## Story

Someone is hobbling or stumbling along! This radical shows a person whose leg isn't quite straight, representing a state of being "off-balance" or "unusual." It tells you that the character might involve something being one-sided, bent, or standing out from the norm. Think of it as the radical of the "offset" or the "extraordinary."

## Position

Usually appears at the top or right side of a kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical disability, an uneven state, something standing out, or a person in an unusual position or situation.

## Example Kanji

### 尢 (lame leg)

The base radical itself, representing a person with a bent limb or an uneven walk.

### 就 (settle / take a position / arrive)

Lame leg (尢) + capital (京). It originally meant to "settle" or "take a stance" in a high place (the capital), even if the journey there was difficult or the footing was uneven.

### 尤 (outstanding / plausible / superior)

A version of the radical with an extra stroke, meaning "extraordinary." It represents something that stands out (like an unusual limb) and is therefore "superior" or "unique."
