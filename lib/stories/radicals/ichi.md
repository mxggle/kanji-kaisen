## Origin

The ichi radical is a simple, single horizontal stroke. It is a pictograph representing a single finger or an object held up to count. In philosophical terms, it represents the primal unity and the horizon from which all other things emerge.

## Story

Everything begins with one. This radical is the first strike of the brush that defines the horizon, the first step of a long journey, and the very foundation of the mathematical world. When you see it, think of unity, the beginning of a sequence, and the simple truth of a single entity. It is the radical of the absolute and the starting point of all creation.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the top or bottom of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the number one, the concept of a "first" or "top" position, unity, or the beginning of an action or time period.

## Example Kanji

### 一 (one)

The base kanji for the number one—representing the simplest unit and the start of all counting.

### 天 (heaven / sky / imperial)

One (一) + big (大). Imagine something that is "bigger" than even the "biggest" person on earth—the vast, overhead sky that covers everything as "one."

### 万 (ten thousand / myriad)

One (一) + a symbol for many. A single character used to represent a vast, "myriad" quantity of ten thousand things—too many to count easily.
