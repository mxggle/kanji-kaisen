## Origin

A compressed form of the full 足 (foot) kanji. It is a pictograph showing a leg (the top part) and a foot with toes (the bottom part). It was originally designed to fit neatly on the left side of a character to indicate physical movement.

## Story

Step by step, the foot radical marches along! When you see these strokes on the left side of a kanji, think of walking, running, jumping, or any action that involves your legs. It brings the energy of movement and the physical distance of the journey to the characters it joins.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical movement, traveling, actions performed with the legs/feet, or the concept of a path or journey.

## Example Kanji

### 路 (road / path)

Foot (足) + each (各). A "road" is a place where "each" person places their "feet" as they travel from one town to the next.

### 躍 (jump / leap)

Foot (足) + laundry/flutter (翟). Imagine the quick, fluttering motion of legs as someone leaps high into the air with grace.

### 踏 (step on / tread)

Foot (足) + water/repeat (沓). Think of the rhythmic, repeating motion of feet splashing in water or stepping firmly on the ground.
