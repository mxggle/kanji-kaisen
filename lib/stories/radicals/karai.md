## Origin

The karai radical is a pictograph of a sharp tattoo needle or a tool used for marking prisoners. The sharp "pain" of the needle's sting eventually evolved to mean "spicy" (a burning pain) and the "bitterness" of a difficult life experience.

## Story

Watch out for the sting! This radical carries the intense heat of a chili pepper and the sharp, stinging "bitterness" of a hard trial. When you see it, think of aggressive flavors, the "hot" exhaustion of labor, and the incredible resilience needed to get through the most painful moments of life. It brings a sense of sharp intensity, deep suffering, and the grit of a survivor to its characters.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the main component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a spicy or bitter flavor, physical or emotional pain, hard labor, difficult situations, or the tools used for "stinging" and marking.

## Example Kanji

### 辛 (spicy / hot / bitter / painful)

The base kanji for a sharp flavor that "burns" or a moment in life that is "painful" and exceptionally difficult to endure.

### 辞 (resign / word / dictionary)

Pain/needle (辛) + speech/tangled (舌). Originally referred to "solving" a "tangled" and "spicy" (difficult) legal case through the use of clear, decisive "words."

### 幸 (happiness / luck / blessing)

Spicy/shackles (辛) + available. Deeply ironic in its origin, it referred to being "spared" from the "spicy" shackles of fate—the defining moment of "happiness" for a survivor.
