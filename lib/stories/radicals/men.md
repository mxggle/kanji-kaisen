## Origin

The men radical is a pictograph of a human face featuring a prominent eye at the center, wearing a traditional head covering or a decorative mask (the outer border). It represents the direct, frontal view of an object or person.

## Story

Put on a brave face! This radical represents the part of ourselves that we show to the outer world—the face, its unique expressions, and the social masks we wear to navigate different situations. When you see it, think of physical surfaces, cardinal directions, and the "front" of any complex situation. It brings a sense of identity, direct interaction, and the visible boundary between our inner self and the external world.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the main component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical surfaces (of a sphere, for example), human faces and expressions, directions (one-sided), masks, or the public-facing aspect of a situation.

## Example Kanji
