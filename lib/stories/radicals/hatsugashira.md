## Origin

The hatsugashira radical is a pictograph of a pair of legs or feet facing outward in opposite directions. It represents the powerful, wide-legged stance of a person who is "tramping," marching, or making a strong physical step forward.

## Story

Stomp, stomp! You see someone marching firmly with their legs spread wide for balance. This radical brings the energy of assertive presence and decisive movement to its kanji. When it sits at the top of a character, think of climbing high mountains, departing on a grand journey, or the assertive stride of a person who knows exactly where they are going.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical movement (marching, tramping), ascending or climbing, starting a journey, or the force of an outspread stance.

## Example Kanji

### 登 (climb / ascend / register)

Outspread feet (癶) + ritual vessel/bean (豆). Imagine someone stepping firmly over a sacred vessel to reach the high "climb" of a mountain summit.

### 発 (emit / departure / publish)

Outspread feet (癶) + a bow (弓). The forceful "marching" legs combined with a bow, representing a projectile being launched or a traveler "departing" for a new goal.

### 癶 (tramp feet)

The base radical itself, capturing the powerful, outspread gait of a person in active motion.
