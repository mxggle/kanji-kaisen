## Origin

A compressed form of the 耳 (ear) kanji. It remains a pictograph of a human ear with its distinctive outer rim and delicate inner folds, narrowed specifically to fit perfectly on the left side of more complex characters.

## Story

Lend me your ears! This radical brings the power of hearing, the deep act of listening, and the perception of every sound in the environment to its kanji. When it sits on the left, think of listening carefully, specific sounds like shouts or whispers, and the profound "attention" we pay to the world and the people around us. It is the radical of the master listener and the one who pays close attention to the finest details.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the physical ear and hearing, listening carefully, paying attention, professional jobs (listening to records), or the concept of being "holy" (listening to divine wisdom).

## Example Kanji

### 職 (employment / job / office / post)

Ear (耳) + sound/mark (音/戠). Originally related to a person who "listens" to and "marks" official records with extreme care—the definition of a professional post.

### 聴 (listen / hear / heed / pay attention)

Ear (耳) + heart (心) + virtue (徳/𡩜). To "listen" with your whole "ear" and your sincere "heart" at the same time—the act of paying true, deep attention.

### 聖 (holy / saint / master)

Ear (耳) + mouth (口) + king (王). Someone who can "listen" to the high wisdom of the universe and "speak" it with the authority of a "king"—the definition of a holy person.
