## Origin

The arazu radical represents a pair of wings or birds flying away from each other in opposite directions. This visual of divergence and contradiction evolved from "turning away" into the concept of "not," "wrong," or "negative."

## Story

Look at those two wings pulling apart! They are in total disagreement, flying in opposite directions. This radical is the ultimate symbol of "NO" or "WRONG." When it appears in a kanji, it tells you that the meaning involves something negative, an injustice, or a denial of what is true or good.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as a central component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a negative state, an error, an injustice, or the concept of "not being" something.

## Example Kanji

### 非 (none / wrong / injustice)

The base kanji for "not," "wrong," or "evil"—the core of the negative prefix.

### 悲 (sad / sorrow)

Non (非) + heart (心). Imagine a heart that is in a "negative" or "wronged" state, feeling the heavy burden of sorrow and grief.

### 罪 (crime / sin)

Net (罒) + wrong (非). To commit a crime is to be caught in the "net" of justice for doing something that is "not" allowed.
