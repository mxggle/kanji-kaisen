## Origin

The yamaidare radical is a pictograph representing a person lying on a frame or a primitive bed (represented by the top and left strokes) because they are ill. It captures the essence of weakness and the physical state of requiring medical care.

## Story

Rest and recover! Imagine a person tucked under a blanket, lying in a quiet room while they wait for their fever to break. This radical is the spirit of healing and the struggle against "sickness." When you see it hanging from the top-left, think of the "treatment" needed to get well, the "pain" of a long illness, and the "fatigue" we feel when our bodies are taxed.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP and LEFT of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates sickness, diseases, medicine, hospitals, medical treatment, physical weakness, fatigue, or the concept of a long-term ailment.
