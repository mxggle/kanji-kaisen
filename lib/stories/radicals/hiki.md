## Origin

The hiki radical is a complex pictograph that originally showed a leg and a foot (similar to 足). Over time, it came to represent a "bolt of cloth" because fabric was traditionally measured by the length of a foot or the number of paces.

## Story

Measure it out! This radical is a unique blend of the human body and the world of commerce. Whether it represents the foot that walks the path or the fabric that is measured by those same feet, "hiki" stands for structure, quantity, and the physical foundations of trade. Think of it as a measurement of both physical progress and material wealth.

## Position

Often appears at the bottom or on the left side of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates feet/legs, units of measurement (especially for cloth), the concept of distance, or material items that are measured out.

## Example Kanji

### 疑 (doubt / suspect / question)

Bolt/foot (疋) + arrow (矢) + mountain (山). Imagine someone standing on a mountain peak, looking at a distant arrow and "measuring" their uncertain thoughts in a state of deep doubt.

### 疋 (bolt of cloth / foot)

The base radical itself, representing a specific unit of measurement for both physical travel and woven textiles.

### 疎 (alienated / sparse / distant)

Bolt/foot (疋) + bunch/bundle (束). To "measure" a wide space between items that are normally "bundled" together—suggesting a distance or a feeling of being alienated.
