## Origin

The samurai radical is a pictograph of an ancient axe or a ceremonial weapon held by a man of status. It originally represented a scholar-official or a warrior who had achieved a certain rank in society. It is distinguished from "earth" (土) by its longer top horizontal stroke.

## Story

Stand tall with honor! This radical represents the elite class of society—the warriors, scholars, and officials. When you see it, think of a person with specialized skills, a high rank, or the discipline of a samurai. It brings a sense of status, masculinity, and structured authority to the kanji it joins.

## Position

Can appear as a standalone kanji, on the left, or at the bottom/center of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates males of high status, scholars, warriors, specific professions, or the concept of vigor and social standing.

## Example Kanji

### 士 (military man / professional)

The base kanji for a man of status or a trained professional, used as a suffix for many occupations today (like "attorney" or "scholar").

### 壮 (vigorous / majestic)

Samurai (士) + bed/frame. Represents a "man" in the prime of his life, full of energy and "vigor," standing strong like a majestic warrior.

### 吉 (good luck / joy)

Samurai (士) + mouth (口). Originally referred to the wise "words" spoken by a high-ranking "scholar," which were considered a sign of "good luck" and great joy.
