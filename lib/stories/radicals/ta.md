## Origin

The ta radical is a literal pictograph of a rice paddy viewed from above. The square frame represents the boundaries of the field, and the internal cross (十) represents the dikes or paths that divide the field into four smaller sections for irrigation and management.

## Story

The lifeblood of the village! Imagine a patchwork of green rice fields stretching across a fertile valley. This radical represents the hard work of the farmer, the bounty of the earth, and the organized structure of agricultural society. When you see it, think of wealth, land, and the rhythmic cycle of the planting and harvest seasons.

## Position

Standalone kanji or can appear at the top, bottom, or center of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates rice fields, land, agricultural work, physical strength (man in the field), wealth, and the organization of space for production.

### 町 (town / village)

Rice field (田) + nail/block (丁). Represents an area divided into specific "blocks" or "rice fields" where people settled together—the origin of a small "town."
