## Origin

A pictograph of a human leg and foot. The top portion (口) represents the knee or calf, and the bottom strokes represent the foot resting or stepping upon the ground.

## Story

See the foot firmly planted on the earth! The top part is the sturdy leg, while the bottom shows the foot ready to take a bold step forward. Curiously, it also means 'to be enough'—perhaps because when your feet have carried you across the finish line, you have reached sufficiency.

## Position

Standalone kanji or on the left side (ashihen) or bottom of a character

## Transforms Meaning

Relates to legs, feet, walking, distance, or the state of being 'enough' or satisfied

## Example Kanji

### 走 (run)

Soil/earth (土) + foot (𠮛) = imagine feet moving quickly and kicking up dust as they race across the ground.

### 路 (road / path)

Foot radical + each (各) = the designated path where 'each' person's feet travel to reach their destination.

### 踊 (dance / leap)

Foot radical + courage/throb (勇) = moving one's feet with great rhythm, courage, and spirit—the essence of dancing.
