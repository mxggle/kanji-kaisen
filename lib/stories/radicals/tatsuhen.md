## Origin

The tatsuhen radical is the "left side" form of the stand radical (立). It was narrowed to fit beside other components, but it retains the original image of a person standing firmly on the ground, representing the act of establishing a position or reaching an edge.

## Story

Standing on the side! When the "stand" radical moves to the left, it brings the energy of competition, limits, and finality. Imagine a row of people standing at a starting line or at the very edge of a cliff. It represents the boundary where one thing ends and another begins, and the effort required to "stand" against an opponent.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a position, an end/edge, a boundary, competition (two standing together), or the act of reaching a final state or limit.

## Example Kanji

### 端 (end / edge / side)

Stand (立) + special/direct (耑). The very "edge" or "end" where something "stands" apart from the rest—the side of a table or the terminal of a line.

### 競 (compete / race)

Two "stands" (立) + two people (兄 variant). The literal image of two people "standing" side-by-side to "compete" or see who is faster—the essence of a race.

### 竭 (exhaust)

Stand (立) + a hollow/exhaustion. To reach the very "end" or limit where one can no longer "stand"—the act of completely exhausting a resource.
