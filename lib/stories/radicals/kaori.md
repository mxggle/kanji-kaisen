## Origin

The kaori radical is a combination of "grain" (禾) and a component meaning "sweet" or "sun-ripened" (曰/甘). It was created to depict the sweet, lingering aroma of freshly ripened grain baking under the warmth of the autumn sun.

## Story

Breathe in the scent! This radical represents the wonderful aromas of the family kitchen, the flowering garden, and the sacred temple. When you see it, think of rich flavors, the "fragrance" of a high social standing, and the invisible but powerful essence of scent. It brings a sense of aesthetic pleasure, sensory richness, and deep memory to every character it adorns.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the top/left component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a pleasant fragrance or aroma, spices and incense, sensory perception, or the intangible quality of being "sweet-smelling" or refined.

## Example Kanji

### 香 (fragrance / aroma / incense)

The base kanji for a beautiful scent, representing the primary sensory experience of "fragrance" in perfume or cooking.

### 馨 (fragrant / resounding / aromatic)

Fragrance (香) + sounding stone (殸). A "fragrance" that is so clean and powerful it seems to "resound" through the air like the ring of a mountain bell.

### 馥 (fragrant / sweet-smelling / pervasive)

Fragrance (香) + return/repeat (復). Imagine a sweet "fragrance" that lingers and seems to "repeat" itself over and over in the air—a pervasive, heavy aroma.
