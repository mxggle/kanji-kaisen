## Origin

The kohen radical is a pictograph of a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes with its arms outstretched. It represents the concept of a child, a descendant, or a small, precious unit of life just beginning its journey.

## Story

Protect the future! This radical represents the innocence, vibrant energy, and infinite potential of a young child. When it sits on the left side of a kanji, think of family relationships, the nurturing of new life, and the tiny "seeds" from which larger things grow. It brings a sense of renewal, smallness, and familial love to any character it joins, reminding us of the foundations of a lineage.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates family relationships (children, grandchildren), youth and infancy, small or delicate objects, and the starting point or seed of a process.

## Example Kanji

### 孫 (grandchild / descendant)

Child (子) + genealogy/line (系). A "child" who continues the family "line" through another generation—the definition of a grandchild.

### 接 (touch / contact / join / connect)

Hand (扌) + daughter-in-law (妾/子). It originally related to the "hand" reaching out to a "woman/child" to join a family through marriage—meaning any act of contact.

### 孤 (orphan / alone / isolated)

Child (子) + melon (瓜). Imagine a "child" who is as small and "isolated" as a single "melon" left alone in a vast field—the symbol of being an orphan.
