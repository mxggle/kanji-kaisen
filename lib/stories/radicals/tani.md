## Origin

The tani radical is a pictograph of water flowing down from a mountain (the top inverted 'V' strokes) and collecting in a basin or mouth (the bottom 口). It represents the natural formation of a "valley" or a ravine where water gathers and life thrives.

## Story

Deep in the canyon! Imagine the cool, shaded space between two high mountain peaks where a stream flows quietly along. This radical represents the low points of the landscape where everything eventually gathers. When you see it, think of wide open spaces, deep ravines, and the sense of something "hollow" or reaching deep into the earth.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears on the left or bottom of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates valleys, ravines, deep spaces, the act of gathering or containing, or concepts related to desire (reaching for something deep) and admission.

## Example Kanji

### 谷 (valley)

The base kanji for a valley or mountain stream, a symbol of the natural beauty and the geological "low points" of the world.

### 欲 (desire / want)

Valley (谷) + yawning (欠). Imagine a "valley" that is empty and "yawning" for something to fill it—the literal image of a deep "desire" or want.

### 容 (contain / admit / appearance)

House (宀) + valley (谷). A "house" that is as spacious as a "valley," able to "contain" or "admit" many people and things—also used for outward appearance.
