## Origin

The miru radical is a powerful pictograph of a massive eye (目) sitting on top of a person's legs (儿). It depicts a person standing tall and actively looking, watching, or examining the world around them from as high a vantage point as possible.

## Story

I see you clearly! This radical represents the active, conscious act of looking at the world. While the "eye" radical alone is static, "miru" is dynamic—it’s a person using their legs to reach a viewpoint and their eyes to meticulously observe every detail. When you see it, think of watching, witnessing, and the deep understanding that comes from direct, firsthand observation. It is the radical of the observer, the examiner, and the witness to history.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/right of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the act of seeing or watching, mental understanding (insight), being a parent (watching over ), setting standards (seeing what is right), or specific types of visual examination.
