## Origin

The oozato radical is a compressed form of the "village" or "city" kanji (邑). It is a pictograph of a person kneeling beneath a walled enclosure, representing a settled community or a place where people live under a shared authority.

## Story

Welcome to the village! This "big town" radical brings the feeling of community, borders, and organized civilization to a kanji. When you see it on the right side, imagine a busy city street or a quiet country village. It's the radical of geography, settlement, and the places we call home.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates villages, towns, cities, districts, geographical locations, or the concept of a settled country or community.
