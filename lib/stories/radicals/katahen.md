## Origin

A compressed form of the 片 (split wood) kanji. It remains a pictograph of a single half of a split log, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of characters that involve fragments, publishing, and tablets.

## Story

Split it right! This radical represents the physical objects made from split wood and the conceptual "sides" of an issue. When it sits on the left, think of tablets, woodblock printing, playing cards, and anything that is one part of a balanced pair. It is the radical of the fragment, the playing card, and the printed page, bringing the weight of history and the power of the press to its characters.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates fragments of wood, tablets for records, wooden signs, cards used for gaming, and the act of publishing or reproducing information.
