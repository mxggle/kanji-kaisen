## Origin

The sanzukuri radical consists of three parallel diagonal strokes. It is a pictograph representing fine lines, such as a strand of hair, the grain of wood, or the radiant rays of light spreading from a source. It captures the essence of texture and visual appearance.

## Story

A touch of elegance! Imagine three fine strokes of a brush adding the final detail to a painting. This radical represents the "look" of a thing—its texture, its shadow, or the way it reflects light. When you see it on the right side, think of a decorative pattern, a beautiful hairstyle, or the subtle rays of a setting sun.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical appearance, texture (hair, grain), decorative patterns, light rays, or the concept of an image/shadow.
