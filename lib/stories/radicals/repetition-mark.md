## Origin

The nonomoji (々) is not a true kanji, but a specialized symbol used in Japanese to indicate the repetition of the preceding character. It evolved from a simplified form of the character "nijuu" (二 - two), acting as a shorthand for "repeat what was just written."

## Story

Double it up! Imagine a quick, elegant mark that tells you to say it again. Instead of writing the same complex kanji twice, this symbol jumps in to save time and add a rhythmic flow to the text. When you see it, think of a mirror reflecting the previous word, doubling its power and meaning.

## Position

Always follows the kanji it is repeating.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates pluralization (mountains, people), intensification (sometimes), or a sequence of identical actions or objects.

## Example Kanji

### 々 (repetition mark)

The symbol itself, used to create plurals or emphasize frequency in common Japanese vocabulary.

### 山々 (mountains)

Mountain (山) + repetition mark (々). Instead of just one peak, you have a whole range of "mountains" stretching across the horizon.

### 人々 (people)

Person (人) + repetition mark (々). A group of individuals gathered together to form "people"—the collective essence of humanity.
