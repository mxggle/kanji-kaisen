When you see it on the left, think of cooking, daily nutrition, small particles (like grains of sand or powder), and the vast energy of the harvest. It is the radical of the kitchen, the farm, and the fundamental sustenance that keeps life moving forward.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.
