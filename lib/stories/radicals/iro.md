## Story

The world is full of vibrant hues! This radical captures the colors of our environment and the deep emotions that flush our skin with passion, embarrassment, or joy. When you see it, think of visual beauty, variety, and the wonderful "bloom" of life. It brings the richness of the artist's palette and the intensity of human feeling to its characters.

## Example Kanji

### 色 (color / hue / charm)

The base kanji for the spectrum of light and the quality of physical "charm" or attractiveness in a person or object.

### 絶 (extinguish / beyond / unique)

Fine thread (糸) + color (色). It originally meant to "cut" or "finish" a piece of "colored" thread, eventually meaning something "unique" that is "beyond" comparison.

### 艷 (glossy / sexy / radiant)

Rich/abundant (豊) + color (色). Imagine a "rich" and vibrant "color" that has a beautiful, "glossy" and attractive shine—the definition of being radiant.
