## Origin

A simplified, compressed form of 手 (hand). It is condensed into three quick strokes to fit perfectly on the left side of a kanji, representing human agency and action.

## Story

Imagine a hand reaching out from the left to grab, hold, or shape the world! When you see these three strokes, think of a hand in motion. It tells you the kanji involves an action—something being made, hit, measured, or manipulated by human effort.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical actions, especially those performed with the hands or involving manual labor and skill

## Example Kanji

### 持 (hold / have)

Hand radical (扌) + temple/measure (寺) = a hand holding onto something with the same stability and care as a sacred temple.

### 拾 (pick up / gather)

Hand radical (扌) + join/fit (合) = the action of hands coming together to gather items from the earth and pick them up.

### 打 (strike / hit)

Hand radical (扌) + nail/stake (丁) = imagine the motion of a hand striking a nail or a hammer hitting a stake firmly into the ground.
