## Origin

The inu radical is a pictograph of a dog standing alertly, possibly on its hind legs. It captures the essence of the faithful companion and guardian that has accompanied human civilization since its earliest days.

## Story

Woof! This radical represents the loyalty, protection, and keen hunting spirit of the dog. When you see it, think of domestic animals (especially pets), hunting tasks, and the fierce devotion of a guardian who watches over the home. It brings a sense of alertness, companionship, and reliable protection to any character it joins.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates dogs, animal traits (alertness, loyalty), physical conditions or statuses, or actions related to hunting and ritual offering.
