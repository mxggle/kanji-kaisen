## Origin

The shou radical is a pictograph of three small grains of sand or tiny fragments, representing the concept of something being "small" or "minimal." The central vertical stroke is the primary fragment, and the side strokes represent the accompanying pieces.

## Story

Think small! Imagine three tiny pebbles sitting in the palm of your hand. This radical represents the essence of detail, miniaturization, and the humble beginnings of all things. When you see it, think of "little" amounts, "small" objects, and the subtle precision of being focused on the tiny details.

## Position

Standalone kanji or can appear at the top, bottom, or center of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates smallness, a minimal quantity, youth (a "small" person), detail, or a state of being compact or subtle.

## Example Kanji

### 小 (small)

The base kanji for small, used in everything from "elementary school" to describing the physical size of objects and animals.

### 少 (little / few)

Small (小) + a diagonal stroke. Represents something that is even "smaller" or less than small—the concept of having only a "few" or a "little" amount.

### 尖 (sharp / point)

Small (小) + large (大). Represents a shape that is "large" at the bottom and "small" at the top—the literal image of a "sharp" point or a spire.
