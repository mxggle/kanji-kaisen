## Origin

The mame radical is a pictograph of a ritual food vessel or a goblet featuring a stand and a lid. Over time, it came to represent "beans" because they were traditionally stored or offered to ancestors in such containers.

## Story

Small but powerful! This radical represents both the humble bean—a vital source of nutrition—and the sacred vessels used in solemn ritual offerings. When you see it, think of ritual structures, specific food items, and the small, rounded units of the natural world. It brings a sense of sacred respect and everyday nourishment to its characters, reminding us that even small things have great value.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/left of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates beans and peas, ritual vessels and ceremonies, small rounded objects, or higher parts of the body (like the head) during ritual worship.

## Example Kanji

### 豆 (bean / pea / midget)

The base kanji for a small, edible seed and a reference to the archaic ritual vessel shape that once held it.

### 登 (climb / ascend / register)

Outspread feet (癶) + ritual vessel (豆). Imagine someone stepping up firmly to a high altar to offer a "ritual vessel"—the physical act of climbing or ascending.

### 頭 (head / leader)

Ritual vessel (豆) + page/head (頁). Originally related to a "ritual vessel" being placed near the most important part of the body—the "head"—during a solemn ceremony.
