## Origin

The onozukuri radical is a pictograph of a stone axe or a heavy tool used for chopping wood. The vertical and diagonal strokes represent the handle, and the top part represents the heavy, sharp blade ready to strike.

## Story

Chop! Imagine a heavy axe swinging through the air to split a log. This radical is the symbol of force, separation, and the mastery of raw materials. When you see it on the right side of a kanji, think of cutting, weighing (as axes were used as standard weights), and the creation of something "new" from the old.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates chopping, cutting, separation, weighing (units of weight), or the creation of something through forceful action.
