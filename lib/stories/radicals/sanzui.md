This radical evolved from the kanji 水 (mizu - water). The three strokes represent droplets of water falling or flowing.

## Story

Imagine three raindrops falling—that's sanzui! Whenever you see these three dots on the left side of a kanji, think of water, liquids, or anything that flows.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of kanji

## Transforms Meaning

Adds the sense of water, liquid, wetness, or flowing to the kanji's meaning

## Example Kanji

### 海 (sea, ocean)

Water + 'every' = the water that's everywhere

### 泳 (swim)

Water + long movement = moving through water

### 涙 (tears)

Water from the eyes = tears
