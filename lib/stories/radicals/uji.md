## Origin

The uji radical is a pictograph representing a person's lineage or a family name. It originally depicted a tombstone or a landmark indicating the ancestral grounds of a specific clan. It captures the essence of social identity and the deep roots of a family tree.

## Story

Honor your roots! Imagine a grand monument standing on a hill, marking the territory of a noble family. This radical represents your name, your heritage, and the "clan" to which you belong. When you see it, think of the threads of history that connect you to your ancestors and the sense of belonging that comes from having a strong family identity.
