## Origin

The hachi radical is a pictograph of two lines splitting apart. It represents the primal concept of "division" or "separation," where one thing is split into two. Eventually, this simple act of splitting became synonymous with the number eight.

## Story

Split it right down the middle! This radical carries the energy of division and the clarity of separation. Whether it’s sharing a meal fairly, dividing a territory, or simply the number "eight," hachi tells you that the character involves a split or a specific quantity. It is the radical of order and distribution.

## Position

Usually appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/top of characters in different forms.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the number eight, the act of dividing or splitting, or the concept of things moving apart or being distributed.
