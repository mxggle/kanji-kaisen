## Origin

The nogihen radical is a pictograph of a stalk of grain, like rice or wheat, with its head heavy and drooping toward the ground. The top horizontal stroke is the heavy head of grain, the vertical stroke is the stalk, and the diagonal strokes are the leaves.

## Story

The harvest is ready! Imagine a field of golden rice bowing its head in the autumn breeze. This radical is the soul of agriculture and sustenance. When you see it on the left side of a kanji, think of crops, harvests, taxes (which were paid in grain), and the abundance of the earth.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates grains (rice, wheat), agriculture, harvesting, wealth/taxation (originally paid in grain), and seasonal changes.

## Example Kanji

### 秋 (autumn)

Grain (禾) + fire (火). The season when the "grain" turns the color of "fire"—the beautiful golden autumn.

### 私 (private / I)
