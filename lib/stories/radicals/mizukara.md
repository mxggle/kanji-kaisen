## Origin

The mizukara radical is a pictograph of a human nose. In ancient times, people in East Asia would point directly to their nose to refer to themselves, leading to the universal meaning of "self" or "oneself." It also came to represent the starting point or origin ("from") of an action.

## Story

Point to yourself! This radical represents your unique identity and the very starting point of all your actions. When you see it, think of your own presence, your individual self, and the deep origin of a movement or a thought. It brings the power of personal identity and the concept of "starting from within" to every character it joins, reminding us that every journey begins with the individual.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the top of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the self or oneself, the concept of "naturally" or "automatically" (from within), the starting point or origin of time/space, and the physical nose and smelling.

## Example Kanji

### 自 (self / oneself / from / naturally)

The base kanji for referring to oneself, the point where a journey begins, or things that happen automatically (from their own nature).

### 臭 (smell / stink / scent)

Self/nose (自) + dog (犬). Imagine a sensitive "dog" using its sharp "nose" (the self-referencing organ) to detect a powerful and distinctive scent.

### 鼻 (nose)

Self/nose (自) + specialized air passages. The physical "nose" itself, the very organ that people point to when they say "me."
