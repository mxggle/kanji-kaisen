## Origin

The tama radical is a pictograph of three precious stones (jade) strung together on a cord, with a single dot added to distinguish it from the "king" (王) radical. It represents anything round, precious, or gemstone-like, capturing the essence of value and beauty.

## Story

Treasure in your hand! Imagine holding a perfectly round, shimmering jade ball or a string of precious gems. This radical represents the most valuable objects in nature—jewels, pearls, and even the "ball" used in a game. When you see it, think of beauty, rarity, and the "royal" quality of anything that is precious to behold.
