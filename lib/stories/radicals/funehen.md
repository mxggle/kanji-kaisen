## Origin

A compressed form of the 舟 (ship) kanji. It depicts a sturdy, narrow boat with its distinct bow, stern, and the benches or oars represented by the internal strokes, narrowed specifically to fit on the left.

## Story

Set sail for adventure! This radical brings the power of maritime travel, the craftsmanship of boat-building, and the adventure of the open water to its kanji. When it sits on the left, think of vessels of all sizes, the motion of sailing, and the heavy transport of goods across rivers and seas. It is the radical of the master shipwright, the brave sailor, and the tireless merchant.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates ships and boats, sailing and navigation, transportation by water, and the specific parts of a vessel's structure.

## Example Kanji

### 航 (navigation / sail / fly)

Ship (舟) + high/noble (亢). To take a sturdy "ship" and travel across "high" and noble distances—the modern definition of navigation and flight.

### 般 (sort / carry / general)

Ship (舟) + hand/action. It originally referred to a "hand" turning or "carrying" a "ship" to sort goods—now used for general "sorts" or "kinds" of things.

### 船 (ship / boat / vessel)

Ship (舟) + swamp/marsh (沿). A specialized "vessel" designed to navigate through "water" or along the coast—now the standard kanji for any ship or boat.
