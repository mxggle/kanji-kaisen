## Origin

The mu radical is a pictograph of a cocoon or a small, enclosed private space. It represents something that is tucked away, "private," or kept strictly out of the public eye and social discourse.

## Story

Keep it a secret! This radical represents the personal, private details of our lives that we choose not to share with everyone. When you see it, think of self-interest, hidden objects, and the sacred boundaries of your own private world. It brings a sense of intimacy, "exclusive" meaning, and the deep, silent parts of the self to all its characters.

## Position

Often appears at the bottom or as a central component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates privacy or being personal (I/me), secrets and hidden things, self-interest or selfishness, and sometimes formal speech or religious enlightenment.
