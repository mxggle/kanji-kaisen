## Origin

The fushizukuri radical is a pictograph of a person kneeling down in a position of respect, prayer, or submission. In ancient times, this posture was associated with receiving a commission or a "seal" of authority from a ruler.

## Story

Someone is kneeling before a high authority! This radical represents respect, social standing, and the official stamps that mark a person's role in society. When you see it, think of a person in a specific position, the weight of a decree, or the "seals" of approval used to govern and organize a civilization.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates social status, markers of authority (seals), kneeling/sitting postures, or the concept of a specific "joint" or "section" (like a knee).

## Example Kanji

### 印 (seal / mark / stamp)

Hand (E) + kneeling person (卩). A hand pressing an official "seal" down upon a kneeling person (or a document) to grant them authority.

### 卵 (egg)

Originally a pictograph that mirrored the shape of kneeling figures, it eventually evolved to represent two eggs nestled together in a nest.

### 危 (danger / risky)

Person (人) + cliff (厂) + kneeling person (卩). Imagine a person kneeling precariously on the very edge of a steep cliff—a state of absolute danger!
