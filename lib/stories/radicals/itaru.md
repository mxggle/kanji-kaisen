## Origin

The itaru radical is a pictograph of an arrow that has been launched from a bow and has successfully reached its target, striking the ground. It captures the very moment of impact and arrival.

## Story

You have arrived! This radical captures the moment of total completion—the arrow hitting the mark after a long flight. It represents reaching a destination, attaining a high standard, and the ultimate achievement of a goal. When you see it, think of hitting the target, reaching the extreme point of a situation, and the satisfaction of a journey finally coming to its end. It is the radical of the destination reached.
