## Origin

The kata radical is a pictograph of a single piece of wood that has been split down the middle. It represents one half of a whole, specifically a "fragment" or a "side" of a larger object that was once joined together.

## Story

One side of the story! This radical represents the concept of being incomplete, partial, or a single part of a balanced pair. When you see it, think of fragments, one-sided perspectives, and the individual pieces that make up a whole. It brings the energy of the "half" and the beauty of the partial to its characters, reminding us that every piece has its place in the grand design.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or on the left side of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates fragments or pieces of wood, thin tablets/boards, printing and publishing (woodblocks), and the concept of being "one-sided" or partial.
