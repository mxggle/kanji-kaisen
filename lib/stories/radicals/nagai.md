## Origin

The nagai radical is a pictograph of an elderly person with long, flowing hair leaning on a staff. The top part represents the hair blowing in the wind, and the bottom horizontal and vertical strokes represent the person and their cane. Because hair continues to grow over time, it became the symbol for "long" and "elder/chief."

## Story

Time stretches out like the silver hair of a wise elder! When you see these strokes, imagine a journey that goes on and on, or a leader who has seen many years. It is the radical of endurance and leadership, representing both the physical length of an object and the long-term authority of a chief.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or on the left side of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical length, the passage of long periods of time, or the concept of seniority and leadership.
