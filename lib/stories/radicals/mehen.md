## Origin

A compressed form of the 目 (eye) kanji. It remains a pictograph of a human eye with its distinct pupil and lids, narrowed and rotated to fit perfectly on the left side of characters that involve vision and perception.

## Story

Open your eyes to the world! This radical brings the power of sight, the depth of silent observation, and the absolute clarity of perception to its kanji. When it sits on the left, think of looking, seeing, specific eye movements like blinking or staring, and the mental "vision" we use to understand reality. It is the radical of the visual artist, the silent witness, and the sharp-eyed analyst.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates vision and sight, physical parts of the eye, activities like staring or blinking, mental perception, or the state of being drowsy or asleep.

## Example Kanji

### 睡 (sleep / drowsy / slumber)

Eye (目) + drooping/hanging (垂). When the "eyes" begin to "droop" and hang low—the physical state of being sleepy or falling into deep sleep.

### 眼 (eyeball / eye / insight)

Eye (目) + limit/boundary (艮). The physical "eyeball" itself, which defines the "limit" and current scope of a person's vision.

### 眺 (stare / gaze / overlook / view)

Eye (目) + omen/sign (兆). To use your "eyes" to "stare" intensely at the far horizon as if searching for a distant "sign" or an important omen.
