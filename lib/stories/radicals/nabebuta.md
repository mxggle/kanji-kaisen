## Origin

The nabebuta radical is a pictograph of a lid or a cover for a pot or a container. The top vertical stroke represents the handle or the knob, and the horizontal line below it represents the flat surface of the lid itself.

## Story

Imagine a heavy wooden lid being placed on top of a bubbling iron pot—that's nabebuta! When you see this radical at the top of a kanji, think of something that sits on top, covers, or crowns a structure. It brings a sense of enclosure and the idea of being the "head" or the "ceiling" of a character.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a lid, a cover, a high point, or the concept of being situated on top of something else.

## Example Kanji

### 交 (interchange / traffic)

Lid (亠) + father/cross (父/爻 variant). Originally suggested a lid or top being "crossed" or swapped, leading to the meaning of exchange and traffic.

### 京 (capital / ten quadrillion)

Lid (亠) + mouth (口) + small (小). Represents a grand building (like a palace or tower) with a high roof—the absolute center of a capital city.

### 亭 (pavilion)

Lid (亠) + mouth (口) + pillar/stop. A structure with a high roof where travelers can stop and rest; a classic wooden pavilion.
