## Origin

The iru radical is a pictograph of two lines leaning toward each other to form an opening. It represents a person stepping into a space, such as a cave or a doorway, capturing the essential action of crossing a boundary from the outside to the inside.

## Story

Step inside! This radical represents the dynamic transition of entering a new space or inserting an object into a container. It carries the energy of invitation and the beginning of an internal experience. When you see it, think of doorways, joining a group, or the act of becoming part of something larger. It is the radical of the entrance and the start of any deep, internal journey.

## Position
