## Origin

The shin radical is a pictograph of a human eye looking downwards in a gesture of submission or service. The vertical and horizontal lines represent the layers of the eye and eyelid. It eventually evolved to represent a "retainer" or a high-ranking "minister" who serves a ruler.

## Story

Service with a careful eye! Imagine a trusted advisor or a loyal minister watching over the kingdom with dedicated focus. This radical represents the elite class of servants and officials. When you see it, think of duty, observation, and the specialized role of someone who manages the affairs of a state.
