Flexible and strong! Imagine a thicket of green bamboo swaying in the wind, bending but never breaking. This radical represents the versatility of natural materials—used for everything from food and construction to writing tools and musical instruments. When you see it, think of resilience, tradition, and the countless ways nature provides for humanity.
