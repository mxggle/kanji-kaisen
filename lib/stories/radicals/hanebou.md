## Origin

The hanebou radical is a fundamental structural stroke in Japanese writing. It is a pictograph of a vertical line that ends with a sharp, upward-pointing hook (kagi), designed to stabilize and anchor the character.

## Story

Reach down and hook it! This radical acts as the anchor and the stabilizer of the kanji it joins. Think of it as a strong vertical pillar that ends with a firm flick, catching something from below and holding it in place. It gives a sense of structural integrity, completion, and the physical act of "hooking" into reality.

## Position

Formally the main anchor or a central vertical stroke in many characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates structural stability, the act of hooking or catching, completion of an action, or a firm grounding.

## Example Kanji

### 了 (finish / complete / understand)

A single cross-stroke plus the "hook" (亅). It represents a task that has been rounded off and hooked firmly into its final position—finished.

### 事 (matter / thing / incident)

Originally contained the hook to represent a person carrying a tool or an official "hooked" record of the matters and things that have occurred.

### 争 (struggle / conflict / compete)

A hand (E) + the hook (亅). Imagine two hands pulling and "hooking" at a single object in a fierce struggle for control.
