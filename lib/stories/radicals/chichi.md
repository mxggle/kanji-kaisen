## Origin

The chichi radical is a pictograph of a person's hands holding up a stone axe or a heavy tool. In ancient times, the "axe" was a symbol of authority, and the person holding it was the protector and head of the household—the father.

## Story

The father is the pillar of the home! The diagonal strokes represent the strength and authority of a person holding a tool to guard their family and provide for them. When you see this radical, think of leadership, guidance, and the foundational role of an elder. It brings a sense of paternal protection and structure to its characters.

## Position

Usually appears at the top or as a standalone character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates fatherhood, elders, male authority, or the concept of a foundational "head" or leader.

## Example Kanji

### 父 (father)

The base kanji for one's male parent, representing protection and ancestral authority.

### 釜 (cauldron / large pot)

Father (父) + gold/metal (金). Imagine a "fatherly" large, heavy pot—sturdy, reliable, and used to feed the entire household gathered around the hearth.

### 爺 (grandfather / old man)

Father (父) + the character "ya" (耶). A direct extension of the father radical to represent the elder "father" of the family—the grandfather.
