## Origin

The to radical is a pictograph of a single-leaf door, specifically a wooden door hanging on a hinge. The top horizontal stroke is the header, the left vertical stroke is the jamb, and the internal strokes represent the panel of the door itself.

## Story

Knock on the door! Imagine the wooden door of a traditional house swinging open to welcome a guest. This radical represents the home, the private space of a household, and the act of entering or leaving a room. When you see it, think of the boundaries of a family, the protection of a dwelling, and the many stories that happen behind closed doors.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears at the top or left of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates doors, households, family units, private spaces, or concepts related to returning home or covering a room.
