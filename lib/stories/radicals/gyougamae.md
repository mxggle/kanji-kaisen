## Origin

The gyougamae radical is a pictograph of a four-way crossroads. The left side (彳) and the right side (亍) combine to show a place where two paths intersect, representing the physical space of a road and the actions taken upon it.

## Story

You stand at a bustling crossroads! This radical represents motion, travel, and the way we "conduct" ourselves as we move through the world. When you see these two sides "enclosing" a character like a street, think of people moving along a path, taking decisive action, or following a certain code of behavior. It is the radical of the journey and the path of life.

## Position

Wraps around the central component of the kanji from both the left and right sides.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates travel, movement, streets, public conduct, specialized techniques, or the act of guarding a specific path.
