## Origin

A compressed form of the 木 (tree) kanji. It depicts a strong tree with its central trunk, spreading branches, and deep roots, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of more complex characters.

## Story

Deep roots and tall branches! This radical brings the life, strength, and endless utility of the forest to its kanji. When you see it on the left, think of raw timber, fine wooden tools, specific species of trees, and the steady, organic growth of the natural world. It is the radical of the carpenter's skill, the forest path, and the enduring materials that build our civilization.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates trees, wood, timber, carpentry tools, objects made from wood (furniture, boards), and the general concepts of growth and nature.

## Example Kanji

### 村 (village / town)

Tree (木) + inch/rule (寸). It originally referred to a small settlement founded at the edge of a specific, managed group of "trees."

### 板 (board / plank / plate)

Tree (木) + reverse/return (反). A sturdy piece of "wood" that has been split and flattened into a single "plank" or "board" for construction.

### 林 (woods / grove / forest)

Tree (木) + tree (木). Two "trees" standing side by side—the literal representation of a gathering of many trees in a "woods."
