## Origin

The takekanmuri radical is the "crown" form of the bamboo radical (竹). It represents the same two stalks with drooping leaves, but flattened and positioned on top to show that the character below is related to objects made from or inspired by bamboo.

## Story

Under the bamboo canopy! This radical brings the practicality and craftsmanship of bamboo to the head of many kanji. When you see it at the top, think of brushes, baskets, ancient documents (written on bamboo strips), and the clever plans and policies that keep a society moving forward.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates tools, documents, instruments, or objects specifically made of bamboo, as well as concepts like planning, measuring, and answering.

## Example Kanji

### 策 (plan / strategy)

Bamboo (⺮) + a thorny branch/whip. Originally referred to a "bamboo" whip used to guide horses, eventually evolving to mean a "plan" or "strategy" used to guide a project.

### 筆 (brush / writing tool)

Bamboo (⺮) + hand holding things. The classic image of a "hand" holding a handle made of "bamboo" with hairs attached—the primary tool for writing.

### 答 (answer / reply)

Bamboo (⺮) + fit/join (合). To "fit" a "bamboo" strip into its matching piece—the literal act of "joining" two parts to provide a correct "answer."
