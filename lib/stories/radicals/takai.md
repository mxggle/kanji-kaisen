## Origin

The takai radical is a pictograph of a multi-story building or a watchtower. The top part represents the high roof, the middle "mouth" (口) represents a window or a room, and the bottom section represents the foundation or a gate. It captures the essence of height and physical elevation.

## Story

Look up at the towers! Imagine a grand tower rising high above the city walls, reaching for the clouds. This radical represents seniority, price, and anything that stands tall and proud. When you see it, think of a prestigious building, a high mountain, or the sense of something being "expensive" and out of reach for many.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears as a central component of a character.

## Transforms Meaning
