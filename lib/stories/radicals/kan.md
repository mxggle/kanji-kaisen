## Origin

The kan radical is a pictograph of a wooden shield or perhaps a pestle used for grinding. Over time, it came to represent both a defensive tool and the act of "drying" something out in the sun until it is hard and firm.

## Story

Stand your ground! This radical carries the energy of the protective shield and the clear, intense heat of the drying sun. When you see it, think of things that are parched, defensive barriers that guard against harm, or the process of "clearing" away moisture. It brings a sense of defensive strength, dry clarity, and unyielding endurance to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/top of characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates dryness or parching, protection (shielding), clearing away moisture, publishing (carving on wood), or a state of level peace.

## Example Kanji

### 干 (dry / parch / air out)

The base kanji for "drying" something (like laundry) in the sun or the feeling of being thirsty and "parched."

### 平 (flat / level / peace)

Shield (干) + a horizontal dividing mark. Imagine a "shield" that has been laid "flat" on the ground after a conflict—the ultimate symbol of peace.

### 刊 (publish / carve / edition)

Shield (干) + knife (刂). Originally referred to using a "knife" to "carve" characters into a wooden board or shield for "publishing" official texts.
