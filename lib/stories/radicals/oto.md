## Origin

Derived from the speech radical (言), but with an additional mark or change that signifies sound in general—not just the spoken word, but the music and echoes of the world.

## Story

A sound emerging from the silence! Unlike 'speech' which is about people's words, 'sound' represents everything audible—the music of a flute, the rumble of thunder, or the gentle echoes in a mountain valley. It is the resonance of the universe catching our ear.

## Position

Standalone kanji or a component within compounds

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates sounds, noise, music, rhymes, or phenomena that can be heard but not necessarily understood as words

## Example Kanji

### 意 (meaning / intent)

Sound + heart (心) = the 'sound' of one's heart translated into a specific purpose or an intended meaning for others to hear.

### 暗 (dark / dim)

Sun (日) + sound = the time when the sun has set and you can no longer see your way, leaving your ears as your only guide to the dark world.

### 響 (echo / resonate)

Hometown/village (郷) + sound = the sound of the world echoing through the valleys of your homeland, creating a deep resonance.
