## Origin

The sounyou radical is a combination of "earth" (土) and a "walking person" (variants). It is a pictograph of a person moving swiftly across the ground, with their arms and legs extended in a rhythmic, energetic pace.

## Story

Pick up the pace! Imagine a runner speeding down a track, their feet barely touching the earth. This radical brings the energy of speed, movement, and "exceeding" boundaries to a kanji. When you see it wrapping around the bottom and left, think of a race, a journey, or the act of surpassing a limit with great effort.

## Position

Wraps around the LEFT and BOTTOM of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates running, swift movement, surpassing/exceeding limits, traveling quickly to a destination, or a state of vigorous action.

## Example Kanji

### 走 (run / move)

The base kanji for running, capturing the essential motion of a person speeding across the landscape.

### 超 (surpass / exceed)

Run (走) + calling out (召). To "run" so fast that you "exceed" the normal limits or "surpass" everyone else—the essence of something "super" or "extraordinary."

### 越 (cross over / exceed)

Run (走) + axe variant (戉). To "run" and use an "axe" to break through a boundary, successfully "crossing over" a mountain or "exceeding" an expectation.
