## Origin

Combines elements showing a foot and a crossroad, representing the act of walking or traveling along a designated path. Its swooping shape under the kanji suggests the road itself.

## Story

This swooping radical is the winding road you walk upon! It curves under the rest of the kanji like a path being carved through a landscape. It carries the essence of progress, journeying, and the constant movement of life toward a destination.

## Position

Always appears at the BOTTOM-LEFT, wrapping under the rest of the character

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates travel, paths, progress, distance, or the physical act of going toward something

## Example Kanji

### 道 (way / road)

Head/leader (首) + movement radical = the path where the leader points and where the feet follow; a way of life or a physical road.

### 進 (advance / proceed)

Bird (隹) + movement radical = imagine a flock of birds flying forward in a straight, determined line. To move toward a goal.

### 遠 (far / distant)

A robe or enclosure (袁) + movement radical = a long, winding path that feels as if you are traveling to the very ends of the earth.
