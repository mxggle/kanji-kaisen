## Origin

The tahen radical is the "left side" form of the rice paddy radical (田). While it looks like the standard field, it is narrowed and positioned to define the action or attribute of the character from the left, emphasizing its role as the foundation of land and labor.

## Story

Grounding on the left! When the rice field moves to the side, it sets the stage for characters related to strategies, boundaries, and the literal soil we walk on. Imagine a row of well-tended fields lining the path. It represents the starting point for organize labor and the careful planning required to manage a great estate.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates agricultural strategies, boundaries, territory, land-based labor, or the concept of something being "abbreviated" (like a map of fields).

## Example Kanji

### 略 (abridged / strategy)

Field (田) + each/every (各). To divide "each" part of the "fields" according to a specific plan—the essence of a "strategy" or an "abridged" summary of land.

### 男 (man / male)

Field (田) + strength (力). The classic representation of a "man" using his "strength" to work in the "rice fields"—the defining role of traditional masculinity.

### 畑 (field / farm)

Field (田) + fire (火). Represents a dry "field" created through the "fire" of clearing land (slash-and-burn), specifically used for crops that don't require flooded paddies.
