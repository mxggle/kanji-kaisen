## Origin

The tatebou radical is one of the simplest strokes in the Japanese language—a single vertical line drawn from top to bottom. It represents a staff, a pole, or the "spine" of a character, providing the vertical axis around which other components are built.

## Story

Stand straight! Imagine a single, strong pillar or a walking staff that holds everything together. This radical is the spirit of verticality and central focus. When you see it, think of a line that pierces through a space, a boundary that divides left from right, or the steady, upright presence that defines a character's core.

## Position

Usually appears as a central stroke or a structural guide within various characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a central axis, a division, verticality, a staff/pole, or provides the foundational structure that "pierces" through other components.

## Example Kanji

### 中 (middle / in)

Vertical stroke (丨) + a mouth/box (口). The literal image of a line "piercing" through the very "middle" of a space—the essence of being inside.

### 旧 (old / former)

Vertical stroke (丨) + sun (日). Originally represented a branch or marker blocking the "sun," eventually evolving to mean something "ancient" or "former."

### 串 (skewer / spit)

Vertical stroke (丨) + two boxes (口). The perfect pictograph of a wooden "skewer" piercing through two pieces of food—the literal act of skewering.
