## Origin

The koromo radical is a pictograph of a traditional robe or garment, showing the collar, the body of the robe, and the flowing sleeves. It represents the outer layer of protection and social status worn by humans.

## Story

Dress for the occasion! This radical represents the protective layers we wear and the social identity that fine clothing provides. When you see it at the bottom or as a standalone kanji, think of textiles, fashion, and the "cloak" that either hides or reveals our true nature. It brings a sense of elegance, protection, and cultural refinement to all of its characters.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the bottom component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates clothes, garments, the act of wearing or covering, social status, or the process of decline (when clothes become ragged).

## Example Kanji

### 衣 (clothes / garment / coating)

The base kanji for any item of clothing or the protective "coating" and outer layer of an object.

### 衰 (decline / wane / weaken)

Clothes (衣) + a mark of age. Imagine someone's "clothes" becoming worn, thin, and ragged over time—the symbol of physical or social "decline."

### 衷 (heart / inner feelings / sincere)

Middle (中) + clothes (衣). The "middle" or "sincere" feelings that are hidden deep under one's "clothes"—referring to one's true, innermost thoughts.
