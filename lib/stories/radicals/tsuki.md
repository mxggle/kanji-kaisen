## Origin

The tsuki radical is a pictograph of a crescent moon with two horizontal clouds drifting across it. It represents the night sky, the rhythm of the months, and the illuminating clarity of the moonlight. Note: On the left side, it often becomes "nikuzuki" (flesh), but as "tsuki," it remains focused on time and light.

## Story

The silver glow of the moon! Imagine the quiet beauty of a full moon rising over a dark horizon, marking the passage of time. This radical represents the cycles of the month and anything that is bright, clear, and hopeful. When you see it, think of "good news," the "period" between seasons, and the "cheerful" light that guides us through the night.

## Position
