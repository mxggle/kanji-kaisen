## Origin

The shitamizu radical is a flattened "bottom" form of the "water" radical (水). It was reshaped to sit beneath other components, but it retains the original image of a central stream of water with splashes on either side.

## Story

Cool water from below! Imagine a clear spring bubbling up beneath a character, providing the life-force needed to grow. While it looks slightly different from the standard "water," it brings the same cooling and nurturing energy. When you see it at the bottom, think of a deep well or a hidden stream flowing under the surface.

## Position

Always appears at the BOTTOM of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates water, fluids, nurturing energy, the act of seeking (like finding a spring), or a state of peace and replenishment.

## Example Kanji

### 求 (seek / demand)

Water (氺) + a furs/clothes variant. Originally depicted an animal's "pelt" being washed in "water," eventually evolving to mean "seeking" or "demanding" something essential.

### 泰 (peaceful / Thailand)

Large + water (氺) + hands. Represents a person with their hands over a "large" amount of "water," suggesting a calm, "peaceful" state or the name for Thailand.

### 黍 (millet)

Grain + water (氺). A type of "grain" (millet) that requires plenty of "water" to grow—a staple of ancient agriculture.
