## Origin

The natsuashi radical is a pictograph of a foot pointing downwards, suggesting the action of stepping or treading. It is a variant of the "movement" and "foot" radicals, specifically emphasizing a deliberate or dragging pace, as if someone is walking slowly through the heat of summer.

## Story

Drag your feet! Imagine the sun beating down so fiercely that you can only take slow, heavy steps. This "summer foot" radical brings the feeling of gradual progress and measured movement to a kanji. When you see it, think of a slow pace, a downward step, or the steady, inevitable movement of time.

## Position

Always appears at the BOTTOM of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates slow movement, stepping downwards, the passage of a season, or a sense of deliberate change.

## Example Kanji

### 夏 (summer)

Head/page (頁) + go slowly (夊). Imagine a person with their face (head) tilted up, walking slowly through the intense heat of the summer sun.

### 変 (change / strange)

Words (言) + go slowly (夊 variant). Originally related to the gradual, sometimes "strange" way that words or situations transform over time.

### 各 (each / every)
