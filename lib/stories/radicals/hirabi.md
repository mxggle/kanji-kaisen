## Origin

The hirabi radical is a pictograph of a mouth with a horizontal line inside it, representing breath or words emerging from the throat. While it looks like a flattened version of the "sun" radical (日), its original meaning is entirely focused on the act of speech and declaration.

## Story

Take a deep breath and speak your truth! This radical represents the powerful act of opening one's mouth to let out a word, an opinion, or a command. When you see it, think of "saying," "stating," or "declaring." It brings the weight of the spoken word and the clarity of a direct statement to its characters, reminding us that speech is the foundation of human connection.
