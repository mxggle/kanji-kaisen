## Origin

The nikuzuki radical is the compressed form of "flesh" (肉) when it appears on the left side of a kanji. While it looks identical to the "moon" (月), it actually represents muscle and body tissue. The internal strokes represent the fibers of meat, narrowed to sit beside other components.

## Story

It looks like the moon, but it's actually muscle! When you see this "moon" on the left side of a character, don't think of the night sky—think of your own body. It is the radical of organs, limbs, and physical life. From your heart to your skin, nikuzuki is the building block of the human anatomy in the world of kanji.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates parts of the human body, internal organs, physical conditions, or aspects of biological life and health.

## Example Kanji

### 臓 (internal organ)

Flesh (月) + storage/hide (蔵). The "flesh" that is hidden and "stored" safely inside your body—your vital internal organs.

### 腸 (intestine)

Flesh (月) + sun/bright (陽 variant). This refers to the long, winding "flesh" of the digestive system that processes the nourishment you take in.

### 肌 (skin)

Flesh (月) + desk/table (几). Originally suggested the "flesh" that is as smooth and flat as a wooden table—the delicate surface of your skin.
