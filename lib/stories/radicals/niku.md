## Origin

The niku radical is a pictograph of a slice of meat, specifically showing the internal structure and fibers of the muscle. The outer frame is the boundary of the cut, and the internal strokes represent the layers of flesh and bone within.

## Story

A juicy cut of meat! This radical represents the physical substance of animal and human life. When you see it, think of strength, nutrition, and the literal "flesh and blood" of a creature. It brings the reality of the biological body and the raw materials of nourishment to the kanji it inhabits.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears at the bottom or left (often as nikuzuki) of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Relates to physical flesh, food, body parts, biological organs, or the concept of something being "meaty" or substantial.

## Example Kanji

### 肉 (meat / flesh)

The base kanji for meat or the physical body, used in everything from culinary contexts to biological descriptions.

### 腐 (rot / decay)

Meat (肉) + government office (府). Imagine meat left sitting in a "government office" for too long—it eventually begins to rot and decay!

### 脂 (fat / lard)

Meat (肉/月) + delicious (旨). This refers to the most "delicious" and flavorful part of the meat—the rich, satisfying fat.
