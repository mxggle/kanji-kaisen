## Origin

The furutori radical is an ancient pictograph of a small, short-tailed bird such as a sparrow or a dove. "Furutori" literally means "old bird" because it is one of the original symbols used to represent feathered creatures in early writing.

## Story

Look at those folded wings and that sturdy little body! This is the bird that rests on the garden branches and chirps at dawn. When you see this radical, think of the quick flight, the gathering of flocking birds, and the lively nature of feathered creatures. It often appears in characters relating to high aspirations or social gatherings.

Commonly appears on the right side of the kanji.
