## Origin

The otsu radical is a pictograph of a sprouting plant's first shoot as it struggles to push through the hard earth, or a young bird emerging from its shell. Its distinct Z-shape captures the tension and effort of a new life beginning, eventually becoming the rank for "the second."

## Story

Push through the barrier! Imagine a tiny sprout winding its way upward, bending and twisting to find the sun. This radical represents effort, potential, and the stage that follows the very first beginning. When you see this curve, think of a life force that is just starting to take shape, winding its way through the world.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/right of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a secondary rank (second in a series), a budding state, a winding shape, or the concept of effort and potential growth.

## Example Kanji

### 九 (nine)

The number nine, which in its ancient form was related to the winding "Z" of a hand reaching the "end" of the single-digit numbers.

### 乳 (milk / breast)

Bird/sprout (乙) + claw + child. Originally depicted a mother bird (using its "claw") feeding "milk" or nourishment to its "child" during its early growth (乙).

### 乾 (dry / drought)

Rising sun (倝) + winding sprout (乙). The sun beating down on a "sprout" until the moisture is gone, leaving the land parched and "dry."
