## Origin

The madare radical is a pictograph of a building featuring only a single side wall and a roof, typically built against a cliff or a hillside for stability. It represents simpler, functional structures like sheds, shops, and community buildings.

## Story

Build on the hillside! This radical represents practical buildings that provide shelter while leaning directly into the landscape. When you see it wrapping over the top and left, think of public marketplaces, storage sheds, and the specialized "places" where people gather to trade, learn, or heal. It brings a sense of communal space and sturdy, functional architecture to its characters.

## Position

Wraps around the top and left side of the kanji (representing a slant roof and one wall).

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates buildings (shops, halls, warehouses), specific places of business or care, large public structures, and the concept of "degree" or "measure" within a space.

## Example Kanji

### 店 (shop / store / restaurant)

Slant roof (广) + occupy/fortune (占). A specific "building" that "occupies" a piece of land for the purpose of trade—the literal definition of a shop.

### 度 (degree / time / measure)

Slant roof (广) + hand (廿/又). It originally related to a "hand" measuring out storage spaces under a "roof"—representing a specific unit of "degree" or "time."

### 庫 (warehouse / storage / garage)

Slant roof (广) + car (車). A functional "building" designed specifically to house and protect a valuable "car" or chariot—the definition of a warehouse.
