## Origin

The shimesu radical is a pictograph of a stone altar or a table used for religious offerings. The top horizontal line represents the surface of the altar, and the vertical strokes represent the blood or libations dripping down, showing the connection between the human and the divine.

## Story

Make an offering! This radical is the gateway to the sacred world. Imagine a solemn festival at a shrine where an altar is piled high with gifts. It represents the act of "showing" or "revealing" one's intentions to the spirits. When you see it, think of ritual, ceremony, and the power of a formal presentation.
