## Origin

The dai radical is a pictograph of a person standing with their arms and legs spread wide, occupying as much space as possible. It is the universal gesture for "large" or "big," capturing the essence of scale through human posture.

## Story

Stretch out wide! This radical represents anything that is grand, important, or massive in scale. When you see it, think of a person making themselves huge to show exactly how big something is. It brings a sense of power, great size, and major importance to its characters, reminding us of the human scale against which all things are measured.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji, at the top (daikanmuri), or as the main component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates size and scale (large, great), importance (major, master), physical expanse (wide), or the concept of something reaching its full potential.

## Example Kanji

### 大 (large / big / great)

The base kanji for scale, used to describe everything from physical size to the greatness of a person's character or the importance of an event.

### 天 (heaven / sky)

Large (大) + a line above. Imagine a giant person (大) with the vast, infinite "sky" or "heaven" resting just above their head—the highest point reachable.

### 奏 (play music / report)

Large (大) + hands + wood. It originally related to offering a "great" gift or a "report" to a superior with both hands—now commonly used for the grand performance of music.
