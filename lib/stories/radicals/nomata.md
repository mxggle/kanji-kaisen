## Origin

The nomata radical is a pictograph of a pair of legs or a person walking. It is very similar to the "natsuashi" (夊) radical but often emphasizes the act of walking behind or "following" someone else, suggesting a trailing movement.

## Story

Walk in my footsteps! Imagine a person walking behind another, following their path. This radical brings the energy of following, chasing, and gradual movement to a kanji. When you see it, think of a sequence, a trailer, or a change that follows another event. It's the radical of the "follower."

## Position

Commonly appears at the BOTTOM or in the center of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates following, trailing movement, a sequence of events, or a transformation that results from an earlier action.

## Example Kanji

### 変 (change / strange)

Words (言) + following/slow (夂). A situation where "words" are "followed" by a strange or unexpected shift—the literal act of changing.

### 夏 (summer)

Head (頁) + following/slow (夂). While also associated with natsuashi, it represents the heat that "follows" the spring and makes everyone walk with slow, heavy steps.

### 冬 (winter)

Ice (冫) + following/slow (夂). The cold season that "follows" the autumn, bringing ice and slowing down all movement in nature.
