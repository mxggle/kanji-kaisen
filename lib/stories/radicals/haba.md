## Origin

The haba radical is a pictograph of a piece of woven cloth or a towel hanging from a line to dry. It captures the essential, flexible nature of fabrics that were used as clothing, banners, or covers in ancient daily life.

## Story

Fresh from the loom! This radical represents the soft, woven materials we use every day—from a simple "towel" to a grand "banner" carried into battle. When you see it, think of textiles, flexible materials, and the world of commerce where cloths were sold or used to cover goods. It brings a sense of utility and craft to any character.

## Position

Often appears at the bottom or as a standalone kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates textiles (cloth, fabrics), clothing, items used to cover or wrap, or things related to markets and commerce.
