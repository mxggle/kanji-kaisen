## Origin

The usu radical is a pictograph of a mortar (a bowl used for grinding). The outer frame is the bowl, and the horizontal strokes on the sides represent the teeth or the grain being crushed within. It captures the essential tool used for grinding grain and preparing food.

## Story

Grind it down! Imagine a sturdy stone mortar sitting in a kitchen, ready to turn raw grain into flour. This radical represents "interest," "amusement," and the hard work of transformation. When you see it, think of the rhythmic motion of grinding and the "excitement" of creating something new through persistent effort and focus.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears at the top or center of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates mortars, grinding tools, preparation of food, intense focus/excitement (as in grinding away at a task), or the concept of a hollow container.

## Example Kanji

### 興 (prosper / amusement / interest)

Mortar (臼) + four hands + mouth/bottom. Imagine many "hands" working together at a "mortar" to build something great—the essence of "prospering" and "active interest."

### 潟 (lagoon)

Water (氵) + mortar (臼) + sun/bird. Originally referred to a "hollow" place where "water" gathers (like a mortar)—the standard kanji for a "lagoon."

### 鼠 (mouse / rat)

Mortar-like head (臼 variant) + body + tail. A pictograph of a rodent, where the "mortar" shape represents its busy, gnawing head.
