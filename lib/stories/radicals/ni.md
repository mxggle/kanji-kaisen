## Origin

The ni radical is one of the simplest and most ancient symbols in writing. It consists of two parallel horizontal lines: a shorter one on top and a longer one on bottom. It is a literal representation of the number "two," but it also suggests the concept of duality, balance, and the connection between heaven and earth.

## Story

One line above, one line below—a perfect pair! This radical is the foundation of balance and counting. When you see these two lines, think of a duo, a repetition, or the space between two boundaries. It brings the power of symmetry and the basic logic of pluralism to every character it touches.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji, at the top, or at the bottom of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the number two, duplication, duality, or a sense of layering and horizontal structure.

## Example Kanji

### 二 (two)

The base kanji for the number two, the starting point for all concepts involving pairs, doubles, and duality.

### 五 (five)

Two (二) + an intersecting X. Originally represented five through the intersection of the "heaven" and "earth" lines, showing the number five as a central pivot point.

### 云 (say / clouds)

Two (二) + a swirling shape. Originally depicted swirling clouds in the "two" layers of the sky (heaven and earth), now used as a formal way to say or speak.
