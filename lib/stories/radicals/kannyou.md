## Origin

The kannyou radical is a pictograph of a container with an open top or perhaps a person's mouth opened wide like a jaw. It represents a receptive space designed specifically to hold, catch, or swallow things.

## Story

Open wide! This radical represents the simple receptivity of a deep bowl and the raw, archaic power of a wide-open jaw. When you see it "wrapping" around the bottom of a character like a floor, think of catching falling objects, guarding a hollow space, and the boundaries of a sturdy container. It brings a sense of storage and the endless capacity to contain the world to its characters.

## Position

Wraps around the central component of the kanji from the bottom and sides.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates containers (bowls, holes), the act of catching or falling into something, openings, or a state of being "sunken" or enclosed from the bottom.

## Example Kanji

### 出 (exit / go out / emerge)

Borders (凵) + a plant/foot stub (止). Imagine a young plant finally "growing out" and emerging from the dark "container" of the earth—the literal motion of an exit.

### 凶 (evil / misfortune / bad luck)

Border (凵) + crossing marks (乂). To fall deep into a "hole" or "container" where dangerous paths cross—the ancient symbol of a bad omen or misfortune.

### 凹 (concave / hollow)

A direct, symmetrical pictograph of a "container" or a depressed shape—representing the pure concept of being "sunken" or concave.
