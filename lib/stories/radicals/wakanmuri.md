## Origin

The wakanmuri radical is a pictograph of a cloth cover or a lid placed over an object to conceal or protect it. It is simpler than the "roof" radical (宀), as it lacks the top chimney dot, representing a flat "crown" or covering used to copy or settle things.

## Story

Place a cover on it! Imagine a thin, elegant cloth being draped over a precious object to keep it safe from dust or prying eyes. This radical represents the act of "covering" or "settling" a character. When you see it at the top, think of the "crown" of a copy, the "lid" on a deep bottle, or the way we "settle" into a final state.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates covers, lids, crowns, concealing, wrapping, or concepts related to copying (placing a sheet over another) and settling/finishing.

## Example Kanji

### 写 (copy)

Cover/crown (冖) + a bird variant. Originally related to the way a bird "settles" under a cover, now the standard kanji for "copying" or taking a photograph.

### 冠 (crown)

Cover (冖) + source + inch/law. A formal "covering" for the head that follows traditional "law"—the literal image of a "crown."

### 冤 (false charge / injustice)

Cover (冖) + rabbit. Imagine a rabbit being trapped under a "cover"—the original image of being "falsely charged" or suffering an "injustice."
