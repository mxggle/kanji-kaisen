## Origin

The compressed form of 雨 (rain) used as a crown on top of other characters. It retains the raindrops and the sky frame but is flattened to fit.

## Story

When the 'rain' kanji sits on top of another character, it squishes down like a heavy cloud. It's like a storm hovering over the rest of the kanji, flavoring the meaning with weather, moisture, and the power of the sky.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji

## Transforms Meaning

Adds a weather-related context or atmospheric condition to the base character

## Example Kanji

### 雷 (thunder)

Rain radical + field (田) = the power of the storm that rumbles over the farmers' fields.

### 零 (zero / spill)

Rain radical + decree/command (令) = small droplets falling one by one, eventually representing 'zero' or small remnants.

### 震 (shake / earthquake)

Rain radical + to move/dragon (辰) = the violent shaking of the atmosphere and earth during a great storm.
