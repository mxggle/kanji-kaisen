## Origin

A pictograph showing a stone (the square 口) lying beneath a cliff (the frame 厂). It represents the raw material extracted from the hills.

## Story

Imagine walking along a steep cliff and discovering a solid, square stone lying at the bottom. This is the essence of hardness and durability. It’s the material ancient people used to build their foundations, sharpen their tools, and carve their secrets.

## Position

Standalone or on the left (ishihen)

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates minerals, rocks, hardness, or objects made of stone, gems, or tiles

Stone + few/small (少) = the millions of tiny pieces of stone that gather together to make up a beach of sand.

### 破 (break / destroy)

Stone + skin/hide (皮) = imagine a stone striking a tough hide and causing it to tear. To break through something solid.

### 研 (sharpen / study)

Stone + even/aligned (开) = rubbing a blade against a stone until it's perfectly smooth and sharp—just like sharpening one's mind through study.
