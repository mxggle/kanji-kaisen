## Origin

The sara radical is a pictograph of a shallow ritual vessel or a serving dish. The outer frame is the rim of the plate, and the internal horizontal stroke represents the food or liquid contained within. It captures the essence of a flat container used for presentation and nourishment.

## Story

Dinner is served! Imagine a beautiful ceramic plate or a sturdy wooden bowl ready to hold a feast. This radical represents the containers of our lives—not just for food, but for our efforts and rewards. When you see it at the bottom, think of a vessel, a platform for serving, or the things we "contain" and offer to others.

## Position

Always appears at the BOTTOM of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates plates, bowls, vessels, the act of serving food, or the concept of something being "presented" or "contained" on a flat surface.

## Example Kanji

Success/completion + bowl (皿). Originally referred to a "bowl" being filled to the brim with food for a feast—now used to mean "prosperous" or "flourishing."

### 盗 (steal)

Desire (次 variant) + bowl (皿). Imagine someone having a hidden "desire" for the "vessel" or contents belonging to another—the literal act of stealing.

### 盆 (tray / lantern festival)
