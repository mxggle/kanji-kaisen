## Origin

The yahen radical is the narrowed "left side" form of the arrow radical (矢). It retains its original pictographic shape of an arrowhead, shaft, and fletching, representing the same energy of directness and speed used to define the action of the kanji.

## Story

Directness on the left! When the "arrow" moves to the side, it sets the stage for characters related to "knowing," "notifying," and the physical "shortness" of an object. Imagine an arrow pointing the way toward a hidden truth. It represents the sharp, focused energy needed to "notify" others or reach a clear "consent."

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates directness, focused knowledge, speed, shortness, notification, or the act of providing a formal consent or answer.

## Example Kanji

### 知 (know)

Arrow (矢) + mouth (口). To speak "words" that are as "direct" as an "arrow"—the fundamental act of "knowing" a fact.

### 短 (short)

Arrow (矢) + bean/vessel (豆). A "short" distance, originally comparing the length of an "arrow" to a standard measuring vessel.

### 矯 (correct / rectify)

Arrow (矢) + tall/high. To "rectify" or "correct" an "arrow" that is not "straight" or tall—the act of fixing a mistake.
