## Origin

A pictograph of a primitive dwelling or cave. The top (宀) represents a protective roof, and the two strokes below suggest an entrance or a pit dug into the ground.

## Story

Imagine a cozy cave carved into a hillside. The sturdy roof keeps the rain out, and the opening below is where you crawl inside for safety. This character represents any kind of hole, pit, or hollow space in the world.

## Position

Standalone kanji or becomes the TOP radical (anakanmuri)

## Transforms Meaning

Relates to holes, caves, vacancies, or the act of digging and investigating

## Example Kanji

### 空 (sky / empty)

Hole + work (工) = a vast, 'worked' hole that goes on forever—the empty sky.

### 究 (research / investigate)

Hole + nine (九) = like exploring a cave to its ninth (final) depth to find the truth.

### 突 (protrude / sudden)

Hole + dog (犬) = imagine a dog suddenly rushing out of its hole! That's the essence of sudden movement.
