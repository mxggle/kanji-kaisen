## Origin

The ten radical is a single, small mark—the simplest element of Japanese writing. It represents a drop of liquid, a tiny seed, or a point of emphasis added to a character to modify its meaning or distinguish it from a similar form.

## Story

The power of a single point! Imagine a single drop of ink falling onto a page, or a tiny spark of light in the darkness. This radical represents the smallest unit of focus and change. When you see it, think of a detail that makes all the difference—like the flame on a lamp or the unique mark that identifies a master.

## Position

Usually appears at the top or within the body of a kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a point of focus, small objects (seeds/drops), emphasis, or used as a distinguishing mark to change the meaning of a base character.

## Example Kanji

### 主 (main / master)

Dot (丶) + king (王). Imagine a lamp with a single "dot" representing the flame—originally meaning the "master" or the central "main" point of a household.

### 丸 (round / circle)

Nine (九) + dot (丶). Originally suggested a shape that has been rounded off or "completed" with a final "dot"—the essence of a perfect circle.

### 丹 (vermillion / red)

Casing + dot (丶). Represents a piece of "vermillion" ore or a precious red stone (the "dot") contained within a mine—the origin of the bright red color.
