## Origin

The ao radical is a combination of a growing plant (生) and a well or a pit containing water (井). It was created to represent the lush, vibrant green of new growth flourishing near a source of water, eventually encompassing the colors of the clear sky and the deep sea.

## Story

Imagine a young sprout shooting up from the earth next to a cool, deep well. It is the color of life itself—the green of spring and the bright blue of a cloudless sky. When you see this radical, think of youth, freshness, and the clarity of nature. It brings a sense of vitality and "newness" to any character.

## Position
