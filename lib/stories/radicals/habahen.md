## Origin

A compressed form of the 巾 (cloth) radical. It depicts a piece of hanging fabric or a towel hanging from a rack, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of characters involving textiles, measurement, and social status.

## Story

Woven from the heart! This radical represents the incredible world of ancient textiles—the banners that flew over cities, the fine silks of the rich, and the simple towels of the worker. When it sits on the left, think of the dimensions of fabric, the specialized tools of the weaver, and the banners of authority. It brings a sense of texture, physical "range," and refined craftsmanship to every character it joins.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates types of cloth and textiles, measurements of width and range, banners and signs, official headgear, or the action of wiping and cleaning.

## Example Kanji

### 幅 (width / breadth / range / extent)

Cloth (巾) + full/abundance (畐). Originally referred to the "full width" of a piece of woven cloth as it came off the loom—representing any physical "range."

### 帳 (notebook / book / curtain)

Cloth (巾) + long (長). A "long" piece of "cloth" used as a curtain or, metaphorically, a long scroll or "notebook" for keeping official records.

### 帆 (sail)

Cloth (巾) + mediocre/ordinary (凡). A large, functional piece of "cloth" (once considered a simple material) that is used to catch the wind and power a ship.
