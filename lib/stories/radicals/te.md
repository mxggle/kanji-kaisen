## Origin

The te radical is a pictograph of a human hand with five fingers spread out. The central vertical stroke is the wrist and palm, and the horizontal and diagonal strokes represent the fingers ready to grip, touch, or perform a task.

## Story

Lend a hand! This radical is the ultimate symbol of human action and creativity. Everything we build, write, and play begins with our hands. When you see it, think of skill, care, and the physical mastery of the world around us. It is the radical of the "maker," the "player," and the "doer" in every story.
