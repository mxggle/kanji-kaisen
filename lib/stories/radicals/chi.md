## Origin

The chi radical is a pictograph of a ritual vessel or bowl (皿) with a single horizontal line inside representing a drop of sacrificial "blood." It was originally associated with sacred ceremonies where blood was offered to the ancestors or gods.

## Story

Look closely at the ritual bowl! The line inside is a drop of blood—the essence of life—offered in a solemn ceremony. This radical isn't just about the fluid in our veins; it represents the deep connections of lineage, sacrifice, and the raw vitality of being alive. It brings a sense of gravity and consequence to any kanji it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or on the left side of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Relates to blood, life energy, sacrifice, lineage, or the physical state of being wounded or alive.
