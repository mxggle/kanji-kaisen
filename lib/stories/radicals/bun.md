## Story

Civilization begins with a single mark. Whether it’s a beautiful pattern on a piece of pottery or a word inscribed on a page, this radical is the soul of human culture. When you see these strokes, think of the elegance of writing, the structure of society, and the enduring patterns of history we leave behind.
