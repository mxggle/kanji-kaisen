## Origin

The sunzukuri radical is the "right side" form of the "inch" (寸) radical. It represents a hand marking a measurement, narrowed and positioned to govern the action or state of the character from the right.

## Story

The marking hand! Imagine eyes watching as a hand marks a legal seal or measures a boundary. This radical brings the energy of precision and "duty" to a kanji. When you see it on the right, think of a rule being followed, a letter being sealed, or the steady "patience" required to measure out a long task.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates duty, legal actions (seals), measurement from a distance, or the concentrated effort and patience needed to complete a task.

## Example Kanji

### 封 (seal / enclosure)

Mound/earth + inch (寸). The act of "measuring" out a mound of earth to "seal" a letter or create a formal "enclosure."

### 耐 (endure / patient)

Beard/face + inch (寸). Originally related to a legal punishment (shaving a beard), eventually evolving to mean the "measured" patience needed to "endure" a hardship.

### 対 (opposite / versus)

Culture/clump + inch (寸). To "measure" one thing "versus" another, creating a pair of "opposites" or a balanced comparison.
