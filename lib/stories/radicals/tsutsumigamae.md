## Origin

The tsutsumigamae radical is a pictograph of a person bending over to wrap or cradle something in their arms. It represents the act of surrounding or "enveloping" an object to protect it or hold it together.

## Story

Keep it safe! Imagine reaching out to wrap a warm blanket around a friend or carefully "enclosing" a gift in paper. This radical is the spirit of protection and containment. When you see it wrapping around the top and right, think of a bandage, a kitchen knife (contained in its sheath), or the "encompassing" nature of a great plan.

## Position

Wraps around the TOP and RIGHT of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates wrapping, enveloping, surrounding, protecting, containment, or objects associated with specific packages (like a bandage) or tools.
