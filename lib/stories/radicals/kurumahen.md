## Origin

A compressed form of the 車 (cart/chariot) kanji. It depicts a top-down view of an ancient chariot or cart, showing its central axle, two sturdy wheels, and the carriage, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of a character.

## Story

Keep the wheels turning! This radical represents the power of transport, the constant rotation of wheels, and the incredible invention of vehicles throughout history. When it sits on the left, think of chariots, modern cars, rolling motions, and the heavy transport of goods and people. It is the radical of the skilled driver, the careful mechanic, and the tireless traveler on the long road.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates vehicles (carts, cars, wagons), wheels and rotation, transport and shipping, physical movement over land, and the mechanisms that involve rolling.

## Example Kanji

### 転 (roll / turn / revolve / move)

Car (車) + rising/steam (云). Imagine a heavy "car" or wheel "revolving" and rolling forward with enough energy to stir up the steam or dust from the road.

### 軽 (light / lightweight / trivial)

Car (車) + pass through (圣). A small "car" or vehicle that can easily "pass through" narrow paths because it is so thin and "lightweight" compared to a chariot.

### 輸 (transport / send / export)

Car (車) + hollow/surplus (兪). To use a sturdy "car" to carry a "surplus" of goods through a "hollow" mountain pass—the modern definition of transport.
