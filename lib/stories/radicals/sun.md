## Origin

The sun radical is a pictograph of a hand (right side) with a mark (the horizontal stroke) at the pulse point, indicating a specific measurement (about the width of a thumb). It represents the "sun," a traditional unit of length roughly equal to one inch.

## Story

Measure it out! Imagine a steady hand marking off a tiny distance with care. This radical is the spirit of measurement, precision, and the small rules that hold things together. When you see it, think of a "bit" of something, a tiny unit, or the careful management of a task through "inch-by-inch" progress.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears at the bottom or right of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates small measurements (inches), precision, law/duty (as laws are "measured" out), ritual, or the concept of a small but significant detail.
