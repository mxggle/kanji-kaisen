## Origin

A compressed version of the 口 (mouth) kanji. It remains a pictograph of an open human mouth, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of more complex characters while capturing the essential tool of speech and consumption.

## Story

Let your voice be heard! This radical represents the mouth as the primary tool for speech, eating, and all forms of emotional expression. When it sits on the left, think of vocal actions like shouting, calling, chanting, and singing, as well as the wonderful flavors we taste and the powerful words we use to define our world. It is the radical of the orator, the opera singer, and the ancient storyteller.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates vocal actions (speech, shouting, crying), eating and drinking, specific sounds or onomatopoeia, and the names of internal organs related to the throat and face.

## Example Kanji

### 呼 (call / shout / exhale)

Mouth (口) + hand/extend (乎). Imagine someone using their "mouth" to extend their voice across a distance—the literal action of calling out to someone.

### 喰 (eat / consume / devour)

Mouth (口) + food/eat (食). A more archaic and intense version of the standard "eat" kanji, showing the "mouth" actively "consuming" or devouring food.

### 唱 (chant / recite / sing)

Mouth (口) + sun/repeat (昌). To use the "mouth" to "repeat" sacred words or rhythmic songs as clearly and brightly as the morning "sun."
