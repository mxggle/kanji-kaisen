## Origin

The todare radical is the "hanging roof" or "top-left" form of the door radical (戸). It represents the same single-leaf door, but it is reshaped to provide a protective "awning" over the other components of the kanji.

## Story

Under the door's protection! Imagine a character seeking shelter under the overhang of a sturdy wooden door. This radical brings the energy of a specific location or a physical "place" to the kanji. When you see it hanging from the top-left, think of an address, a base of operations, or the protective boundaries of a household.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP and LEFT of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates specific places, addresses, households, shoulders (as the "hinge" of the arm), or the concept of a focused location or area.

## Example Kanji

### 所 (place / address)

Door/roof (戸) + an axe variant. Originally related to the sound of an "axe" working on a "door," now the standard kanji for a "place" or an "address."

### 肩 (shoulder)

Door/roof (戸) + flesh/body (月). The "shoulder" is the "hinge" of the "body" (flesh), just as a "door" is the hinge of a room—the part where the arm "hangs."

### 扇 (fan)

Door/roof (戸) + feathers/wings (羽). A "fan" moves back and forth like a "door" swinging on its hinge, originally made from "feathers."
