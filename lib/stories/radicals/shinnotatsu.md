## Origin

The shinnotatsu radical is a pictograph of a giant clam or a shell from which a creature is emerging, originally representing the concept of vibration or the stirring of life. It eventually became the symbol for the Dragon (the fifth zodiac sign) and the morning hours when life begins to wake.

## Story

Wake up with the dragon! Imagine a majestic dragon stirring in the morning mist between 7 and 9 A.M. This radical represents the energy of growth, the vibration of life, and the beginning of a hard day's work. When you see it, think of agricultural labor, the shaking of a tremor, and the powerful spirit of the zodiac dragon.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears at the bottom/center of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates agricultural labor (originally using shells as tools), the morning hours, the dragon zodiac, vibration, shaking, or the stirring of hidden energy.
