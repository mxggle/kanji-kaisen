## Origin

The uma radical is a detailed pictograph of a horse. The top vertical strokes are the mane, the middle section is the body with four legs (the four dots at the bottom), and the right vertical stroke represents the tail. It captures the power and grace of this essential animal.

## Story

Gallop ahead! Imagine a spirited stallion charging across a field, its mane flying in the wind. This radical represents speed, transportation, and the "horsepower" that has driven humanity forward for centuries. When you see it, think of a long journey, the strength of a "stationed" guard, and the unstoppable energy of a horse in motion.

### 駅 (station)

Horse (馬) + standard/ruler (尺). A "standard" place where "horses" were changed during a long journey—now the modern word for a train "station."

### 験 (exam / experience)
