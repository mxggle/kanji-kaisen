## Origin

The hou radical is a pictograph of a person's shoulders or perhaps a hand-held plow. It eventually evolved to represent a "side" or a cardinal "direction" in which a person moves, turns, or faces the world.

## Story

Which way do we go? This radical is all about orientation, perspective, and the path forward. Whether it represents a compass "direction," a specific "method/way" of doing things, or the perfect shape of a "square," "hou" provides the coordinates for our physical and mental journeys. It brings the clarity of purpose and the precise definition of space to any character it guides.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the main component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates directions (north, south, etc.), sides, methods or ways, social status (someone's "side"), or things that have a square or balanced shape.

## Example Kanji

### 方 (direction / side / method)

The base kanji for a cardinal direction, a specific way of performing a task, or the "side" one takes in a debate.

### 旗 (flag / banner)

Direction (方) + that/one (其). A piece of cloth flow in the air to show the "direction" of the wind or to mark a specific "side" on the battlefield.

### 旅 (trip / journey / travel)

Direction (方) + multiple people (从). A group of people moving together in a single "direction" away from home—the definition of a grand journey or a trip.
