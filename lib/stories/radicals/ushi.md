## Origin

The ushi radical is a pictograph of the head of a cow or a bull, viewed from the front. The top vertical stroke is a horn, the horizontal strokes are the face and ears, and the central vertical line is the snout. It captures the essential form of a sturdy bovine.

## Story

Strong as an ox! Imagine a powerful bull standing in a field, a symbol of patience and provider of life. This radical represents the livestock that have supported agriculture for millenia. When you see it, think of physical "strength," the "goods" we produce, and the steady, reliable "vessel" that a cow represents in human history.

## Position

Standalone kanji or can appear at the top or bottom of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates cows, bulls, cattle, livestock, physical strength, animal-based products (milk/meat), or concepts of patience and sacrifice.

## Example Kanji

### 牛 (cow / ox)

The base kanji for cattle, the heart of traditional farming and a primary source of nourishment and strength.

### 告 (tell / announce)

Cow (牛) + mouth (口). Originally related to a "cow" being used in a ritual where "words" were spoken—now the standard kanji for "announcing" or telling.

### 物 (thing / object)

Cow/livestock (牛 variant) + color/variety. Originally suggested a "variety" of "cattle" or livestock—now the general word for any "thing" or object.
