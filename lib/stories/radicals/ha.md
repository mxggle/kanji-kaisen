## Origin

The ha radical is a pictograph of a mouth filled with teeth. The top part represents the gums or the upper jaw, while the bottom part (formerly 米/齿) shows the individual teeth arranged in a row, capturing the structure of biting and chewing.

## Story

Smile wide! This radical is all about the pearly whites in your mouth. Whether it’s the physical act of chewing food, the precision of a gear’s teeth, or the age of a person (which was historically measured by the state of their teeth), "ha" brings a sense of biting, grinding, and sharp, repeatable structure to its characters.

## Position

Usually appears as a standalone kanji or on the left side (as "hahen") of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Relates to teeth, biting, chewing, physical age, or mechanical structures with "teeth" (like gears or saws).

## Example Kanji

### 歯 (tooth)

The base kanji for a tooth, representing the fundamental tool for eating and the marker of physical growth and age.

### 齢 (age / years)

Tooth (歯) + order/command (令). In ancient times, the "age" of animals and people was determined by the "order" and wear of their teeth.

### 齟 (discord / mismatch / clash)

Tooth (歯) + help (助). Imagine teeth that don't meet properly or gears that clash instead of "helping" each other—the literal image of "discord."
