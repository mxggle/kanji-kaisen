## Origin

The aka radical is a pictograph of a person standing above a fire. The top part represents a person (大), and the bottom part represents flames (火). Together, they capture the intense color of a person's skin or an object glowing in the heat of a roar.

## Story

Imagine a person standing so close to a blazing bonfire that their entire body begins to glow with a deep, vibrant red! When you see these strokes, think of heat, passion, and the primary color of fire. It often appears in kanji related to brightness, burning, or blushing with emotion.

## Position

Often appears as the whole kanji or on the left side in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Adds meanings related to the color red, heat, intensity, or the physical state of glowing.

## Example Kanji

### 赤 (red)

The base kanji itself, showing the person over the fire representing the color red.

### 赫 (brilliant / red hot)

Two "red" radicals side by side. Imagine two fires burning together—the result is an intense, brilliant, and radiant glow.

### 赦 (pardon / forgive)

Red (赤) + strike/action (攵). It originally referred to a ritual of "cleansing" or "reddening" to wipe away a crime and release someone from punishment.
