The ito radical is a pictograph showing multiple strands of silk being twisted together to form a strong, singular thread. The top part represents the cocoon, while the bottom strokes show the fine fibers being drawn out and spun.

## Story

Everything is connected! This radical represents the invisible threads that tie us together—our relationships, the fine "silk" of our words, and the intricate weaving of our personal histories. When you see it, think of delicate work, strong connections, and the meticulous process of building something great one small strand at a time. It brings a sense of beauty, unity, and infinite detail to all its characters.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the main component in complex characters involving textiles.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates thread and yarn, silk production, weaving and sewing, social and physical connections, or the concept of being "fine" and meticulous.

## Example Kanji

### 糸 (thread / yarn / string)

The base kanji for a single strand of fiber, representing the fundamental unit of all woven things and the concept of connection.

### 織 (weave / fabric)

Thread (糸) + sound/mark (戠). The rhythmic "sound" of the loom as it interlaces countless "threads" to create a beautiful, finished "fabric."

### 繁 (luxuriant / prosperity / frequent)

Twisting threads (糸) + person + dance (敏). Imagine many "threads" being twisted and woven together in a complex, energetic "dance"—the symbol of richness and prosperity.
