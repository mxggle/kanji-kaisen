## Origin

The juu radical is a simple, symmetrical cross pictograph. It represents a single vertical stroke crossed by a horizontal one, symbolizing the number ten. In many ancient systems, ten was the point of "fullness" or the completion of a basic set.

## Story

Reach the finish line! This radical represents the number ten and the profound sense of arrival and completeness it brings. When you see this cross shape, think of the intersection of all paths and the perfect balance of a finished set. It brings a sense of structural symmetry, numerical order, and the satisfaction of a task well-done to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as a central/top component in complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the number ten, the concept of completion or being "full," cardinal directions (crosshairs), or a structural intersection.

## Example Kanji
