## Origin

The akubi radical is a pictograph of a person with their mouth wide open. The top horizontal stroke and the curves below represent a head tilted back and a mouth gaping, originally suggesting a person yawning or gasping for air because they lack something vital.

## Story

Look at that wide-open mouth! Someone is either so tired they are yawning (akubi) or they are gasping because they are in a state of "lack." When you see this radical, think of an opening, a void, or a missing piece that needs to be filled. It often points to desires, emotions, or actions involving the mouth.

## Position

Always appears on the RIGHT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a state of lacking, an emotional desire, or a physical action involving an open mouth (like singing or breathing).

## Example Kanji

### 歌 (song)

Can (可) + yawn/mouth open (欠). To sing is to open your mouth wide and let out a melody that "can" be heard by everyone.

### 欲 (desire / want)

Valley (谷) + lack (欠). Imagine a deep, empty valley and a yawning mouth combined—it represents a powerful, gaping hollow of wanting or needing.

### 次 (next)

Two (二) + lack (欠). It originally referred to people standing in line, where one person "lacks" or is "missing" the current turn and must wait to be the "next" one.
