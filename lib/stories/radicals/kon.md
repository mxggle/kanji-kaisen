## Origin

The kon radical is a pictograph of a human eye looking backward, representing the act of stopping and setting a "boundary" or "limit" to one's vision and movements. It also captures the essence of things that are "tough" or unyielding like a mountain.

## Story

Know your limits! This radical represents the physical and conceptual boundaries that define our experience. When you see it, think of staying within your current scope, the toughness required to endure, and the clear "divisions" that separate different parts of the world. It brings a sense of stability, firm limits, and resilient strength to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears at the bottom or on the right side of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates boundaries and limits, staying in place, physical toughness and persistence, or the concept of things being "good" (when one stays within proper boundaries).

## Example Kanji

### 良 (good / pleasing / skilled)

Boundary (艮) + a central mark. Something that is "good" because it perfectly fits within its intended "boundaries" and fulfills its natural purpose.

### 限 (limit / bound / restrict)

Hill (阝) + boundary (艮). To face a high "hill" or obstacle that sets a definitive "limit" on how far one can travel or see—the literal definition of a restriction.

### 退 (retreat / withdraw / resign)

Walking (辶) + boundary (艮). To "walk" back toward your own "boundary" instead of moving forward—the strategic or necessary act of retreating.
