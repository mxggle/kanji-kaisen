## Origin

A variation of the "hill" radical (阜). It depicts a stack of terraced hills or steep steps leading up a mountain slope, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of a more complex character.

## Story

Climb high! This radical represents the natural landscape of mounds, hills, and the protective physical barriers they provide for human settlements. When it sits on the left, think of vast geography, great heights, the boundaries of a village, and the walls and slopes that define a place. It is the radical of the surveyor, the mountaineer, and the town planner.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical hills and mounds, heights, buildings/institutions built on high ground, barriers and obstacles, and town boundaries.
