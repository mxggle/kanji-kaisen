## Origin

The nisui radical is a simplified form of the "water" radical (氵), reduced from three strokes to two. It represents ice crystals or drops of water that have frozen solid, capturing the essence of coldness and the transition from liquid to solid.

## Story

Brrr, it's freezing! Imagine two sharp icicles hanging from the edge of a roof. When you see these two strokes on the left side of a kanji, think of winter, freezing temperatures, and the chill of the ice. It brings the power of the "cold" to every character it joins.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates coldness, ice, freezing, the season of winter, or a state of being chilled or solidified.

## Example Kanji

### 冬 (winter)

Ice (冫) + walking slowly (夊). The season where the world turns to "ice" and life moves "slowly" through the snow.

### 冷 (cold / cool)

Ice (冫) + command/order (令). To be "ordered" by the climate to turn into "ice"—the literal sensation of something being ice-cold.

### 凍 (freeze)

Ice (冫) + east/sun (東). Imagine the "east" sun trying to rise, but everything is still trapped in a layer of "ice" and frozen solid.
