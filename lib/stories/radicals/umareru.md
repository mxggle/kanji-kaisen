## Origin

The umareru radical is a pictograph of a sprout emerging from the earth. The bottom horizontal line is the ground, and the top strokes represent the fresh leaves and stem of a plant beginning its "life." It captures the essence of growth, vitality, and the beginning of existence.

## Story

Life finds a way! Imagine a tiny green sprout pushing through the dark soil to reach the morning sun. This radical is the breath of all living things—representing birth, production, and the vibrant "industry" of nature. When you see it, think of "newness," the act of "creating," and the simple, powerful act of being "alive."
