## Origin

The tatsu radical is a pictograph of a person standing firmly on the ground. The top horizontal stroke is the head, the middle part represents the arms or shoulders, and the bottom horizontal line is the ground upon which the person "stands" or "establishes" themselves.

## Story

Rise and stand! Imagine a person standing tall and proud, rooted to the earth with purpose. This radical is the heart of independence, establishment, and the physical act of being upright. When you see it, think of starting a project, building a structure from the ground up, and the strength of character needed to stand your ground.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears at the top or left of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates standing, establishing, starting, independence, being upright, or concepts related to sound (standing at a distance to hear) and darkness.

## Example Kanji

### 立 (stand / establish)

The base kanji for standing, the foundation for all concepts involving being upright, independent, or starting a new endeavor.

### 音 (sound / music)

Stand (立) + sun/mouth (日). Imagine a sound that "stands" alone in the air, or the "mouth" producing a tone that carries across a distance—the essence of music.

### 暗 (dark)

Sun (日) + sound (音). The state where the "sun" has gone down and only "sounds" can be heard in the "darkness"—the absence of light.
