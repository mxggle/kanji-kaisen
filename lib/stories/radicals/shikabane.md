## Origin

The shikabane radical is a pictograph of a person lying down, originally representing a "corpse." However, it also evolved to represent an "awning" or a primitive shelter, as the shape resembles a roof or a covering placed over someone or something.

## Story

Lie down and cover up! This radical has two lives: it can represent the stillness of a body or the protection of a roof. When you see it, think of a person's physical state or a structure that hangs over a space. It’s the radical of residency, belonging, and the boundaries of a character's enclosure.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP and LEFT of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a person's body (living or dead), residency/dwelling, awnings/coverings, or the state of belonging to a specific place.

## Example Kanji

### 居 (reside / be present)

Awning/corpse (尸) + old/ancient (古). Imagine a person "residing" in an "ancient" place for a long time—to live or be present in a location.

### 属 (belong to / genus)

Awning/corpse (尸) + a chain/tail. Originally suggested things that follow or "belong" together under one roof or awning—a category or family.

### 局 (bureau / office)

Awning (尸) + a mouth/boundary. A "governed" space with a roof where official business is conducted—a bureau or an office department.
