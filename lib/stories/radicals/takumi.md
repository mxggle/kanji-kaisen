The takumi radical is a pictograph of a carpenter's square or a tool used for measurement and construction. The top and bottom horizontal lines represent the two parallel surfaces, and the vertical line represents the connection between them, showing the "work" required to join materials.

## Story

Master your craft! Imagine a skilled builder using a carpenter's square to ensure every corner of a new home is perfect. This radical represents the essence of manual labor, engineering, and the "skill" of the craftsman. When you see it, think of construction, industry, and the dedicated effort of someone who works with their hands and mind.
