## Origin

The hitoashi radical is a pictograph of a person's legs and feet. It is the bottom component of the "person" radical (人), showing the lower limbs in a standing, walking, or supportive position.

## Story

Stand tall on your own two feet! This radical represents the physical foundation of a person—their legs and their incredible ability to walk, stand firm, and move through the world. When you see it at the bottom of a kanji, think of the person's physical stance, their stability, or the very act of journeying. It provides the "legs" that support the character's entire meaning.

## Position

Always appears at the BOTTOM of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a person's physical presence, movement (walking/running), standing firm, or the conceptual foundation of a human action.

## Example Kanji

### 先 (ahead / previous / before)

Feet (儿) + ground/growing (土/𡗗). Imagine a person whose "legs" are already moving "ahead" on the ground—representing what came "before" or is "previous."

### 元 (origin / source / beginning)

Person (人/儿) + a top line (二). A person with a mark above their head/legs, pointing to the very "top" or "source" of their being—the "origin."

### 光 (light / ray / glow)

Fire (火) + legs (儿). Imagine a mysterious person with "legs" made of pure fire—someone who radiates a powerful "light" or glow from their very foundation.
