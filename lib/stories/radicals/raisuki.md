The raisuki radical is a pictograph of an ancient wooden plow or a "plowing staff." The top horizontal stroke is the handle, the vertical stroke is the main shaft, and the slanted strokes at the bottom represent the sharp blade that turns the earth.

## Story

Break the ground! Imagine a sturdy farmer leaning their weight into a wooden plow, carving deep furrows into the rich soil. This radical is the heartbeat of cultivation and hard work. When you see it, think of the effort required to prepare the land for a future harvest. It’s the radical of the "toiler."
