## Origin

The yuube radical is a pictograph of a crescent moon rising in the sky, specifically representing the time when the sun has set but the moon is not yet high—the "evening." It is distinguished from the "moon" (月) by having only one internal horizontal stroke.

## Story

As the sun sets... Imagine the soft, orange glow of twilight as the first sliver of the moon appears. This radical is the spirit of transition, the beauty of the "night," and the many "names" and dreams we speak in the quiet of the dusk. When you see it, think of "tonight," the deep "darkness" of midnight, and the peaceful end of another day.

## Position

Standalone kanji or appears on the left or top of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates evening, night, twilight, time periods after sunset, dreams, names (originally whispered at night), and concepts related to darkness and transition.

## Example Kanji

### 夜 (night)

Evening (夕) + person + cover variant. The time when a "person" is under the "cover" of the "evening" sky—the standard word for the "night."

### 名 (name)

Evening (夕) + mouth (口). Originally, since people couldn't see each other in the "darkness" of "evening," they had to use their "mouths" to call out their "names."

### 外 (outside)

Evening (夕) + divining/stick (卜). Originally suggested "divining" the future by looking at the "evening" sky from "outside" the house.
