## Origin

The amigashira radical is a pictograph of a fishing net or a trap woven from rope. In its modern form (罒), it looks like a grid, representing the crisscrossing threads used to catch fish or animals.

## Story

Think of a net cast wide over the ocean or a cage hidden in the woods! When you see this "grid" at the top of a character, it tells you that something is being caught, trapped, or organized into a system. It’s the radical of capture and structure, whether it's a physical net or the "net" of the law.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates catching, trapping, enclosure, or being part of an organized system or set of rules.
