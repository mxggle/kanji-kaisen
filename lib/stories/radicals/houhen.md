Point the way! This radical focus the character's meaning on orientation, methods, and movement. When you see it on the left, it tells you that the meaning involves traveling, finding a specific direction, or the clever "ways" and "methods" we use to interact with the world. It is the radical of the traveler, the explorer, and the master of technique.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.
