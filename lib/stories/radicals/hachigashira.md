## Origin

The hachigashira radical is a variation of the "eight" radical (八) designed to sit at the top of a character. It represents the same primal concept of "division" or "splitting" something into two equal parts.

## Story

Look at those two lines arching over the top like a veil being parted! This radical brings the energy of division and the clarity of separation to the "crown" of a kanji. When you see it, think of things being opened up, shared out from above, or a path that splits into two. It is the radical of distribution and the split perspective.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the number eight, the act of splitting or opening from the top, or the allocation and sharing of resources.

## Example Kanji

### 分 (minute / divide / understand)

"Eight" top (八) + knife (刀). To use a sharp knife to "split" something into smaller parts—dividing it into "minutes" or "sections" you can understand.

### 谷 (valley)

"Eight" top (八) + mouth/opening (口). Imagine a wide-open space that "splits" the massive mountains—the literal definition of a deep valley.

### 貧 (poor / poverty)

"Eight" top (八) + shell/money (貝). To divide and "split" one's shells or coins until there is very little left—the state of being poor.
