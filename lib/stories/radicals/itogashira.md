## Origin

The itogashira radical is a pictograph of a small, single loop of silk thread. It is a simplified and smaller version of the "thread" radical (糸), emphasizing the delicate qualities of being minute, thin, or very young.

## Story

A tiny beginning! This radical represents the smallest, thinnest piece of thread—one so fine it is almost invisible to the eye. When you see it at the top of a kanji, think of things that are minute, delicate, or just starting to grow (like the first "young" sprouts of an idea). It brings a sense of extreme fineness, subtle details, and the fragile nature of youth to its characters.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates extreme smallness (tiny), youth or infancy (thin threads of life), subtle or hidden details, and the concept of something starting as a small loop.

## Example Kanji

### 幼 (young / infancy / childhood)

Tiny thread (幺) + power/strength (力). Describes a person who only has the "tiny" strength of a single thread—the very definition of infancy.

### 幾 (how many / some / several)

Tiny threads (幺) + spear/guard (戈) + person. To "guard" and carefully count many "tiny threads"—the process of asking "how many" are present.

### 幻 (phantom / hallucination / vision)

A variant of the tiny thread shape, representing a "thread" of thought that is so thin and subtle it appears as a "phantom" or a fleeting vision.
