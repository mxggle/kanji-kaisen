## Origin

The mugi radical is a pictograph of a wheat plant with its ears and stalks clearly visible. It features a "feet" component (夊) at the bottom to represent how these essential grains "come forth" and grow from the fertile earth.

## Story

The golden harvest has arrived! This radical represents the staple grains like wheat, barley, and oats that have fueled entire civilizations for millennia. When you see it, think of fresh baking, daily nutrition, and the steady, patient growth of a sun-drenched field. It brings the warmth of the autumn sun and the abundant life-giving energy of the earth to its characters.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or as the main component in complex characters.
