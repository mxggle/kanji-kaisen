## Origin

A compressed form of the 石 (stone) kanji. It remains a pictograph of a rock (the top part) sitting near a cliff or a mountain opening (the square/mouth part), capturing the sheer solidity and weight of the earth's crust.

## Story

Solid as a rock! This radical brings the weight, hardness, and enduring nature of stone to any character it joins. When it sits on the left side, think of geological features, hard materials like minerals and gems, and the tools and structures built from the earth itself. It is the radical of the foundation, the unyielding surface, and the raw materials of civilization.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical stones, rocks, minerals, hardness, the process of polishing or breaking hard objects, and tools/machinery made of stone or metal.

## Example Kanji

### 研 (polish / sharpen / study)

Stone (石) + level (开). To "level" and "sharpen" a blade against a "stone"—representing the steady process of polishing a physical tool or a mental skill through study.

### 破 (break / tear / destroy)

Stone (石) + skin/leather (皮). Imagine a heavy "stone" striking a "skin-like" surface and causing it to "break" or shatter into many pieces.

### 磁 (magnet / porcelain / ceramic)

Stone (石) + thread/continuity (兹). Originally referred to a "stone" (lodestone) that has a strange, invisible "thread-like" attraction—representing magnets and fine pottery.
