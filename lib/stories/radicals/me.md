## Origin

A pictograph of an eye turned vertically. Originally a horizontal eye shape with a pupil (much like a modern drawing), it was rotated 90 degrees for easier vertical writing.

## Story

See the world through this upright window! This is an eye standing tall. The inner horizontal lines represent the iris and pupil. It is the root of all kanji related to seeing, watching, and understanding the physical appearance of the world around us.

## Position

Standalone kanji, on the left side (mehen), or occasionally at the top or bottom

## Transforms Meaning

Relates to vision, the act of looking, mental attention, or the physical eye itself

## Example Kanji

### 見 (see / look)

Eye + legs (儿) = an eye on the move! A person walking while actively observing their surroundings.

### 眠 (sleep)

Eye + civilian/low (民) = when the eyes grow heavy and 'lower' themselves into a deep, peaceful sleep.

### 着 (wear / arrive)

Eye + wool/sheep (simplified) = 'looking' at one's fine clothes or finally 'reaching' the point where you can see your destination.
