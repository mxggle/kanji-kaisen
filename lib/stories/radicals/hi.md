## Origin

A pictograph of the sun. Originally it was a circle with a dot in the center to represent the sun's surface, but it became rectangular over time for easier carving and writing on bamboo and silk.

## Story

The life-giving sun in the sky! This simple box was once a perfect circle, representing the regular rising and setting of the sun that marks the rhythm of our lives. When you see it, think of daylight, clarity, and the passage of time.

## Position

Standalone, on the left (hihen), or at the top of the kanji

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the sun, daylight, specific times, dates, or the concept of brightness
