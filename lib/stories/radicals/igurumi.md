## Origin

The igurumi radical is a pictograph of a wooden stake or perhaps a ceremonial arrow with a string attached. It was originally used for rituals or for catching birds by "hooking" them with a tethered projectile.

## Story

Aim true! This radical represents the tools of tradition and the precision of a ritual hunt. When you see it, think of solemn ceremonies, specific formulas and rules, and the act of "staking a claim" or catching something with deliberate care. It brings a sense of ancient order, focused action, and the "staking out" of a position to its characters.

## Position

Usually appears on the right side or as a central component in complex kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates ceremonial or formal procedures, specific formulas/styles, the act of substituting or taking turns, or "staking" a physical or logical claim.
