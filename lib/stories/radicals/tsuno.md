## Origin

The tsuno radical is a pictograph of an animal's horn. The top part is the pointed tip, and the bottom "mouth" (口) represents the base where it attaches to the skull. It captures the essence of something sharp, protruding, and used for both defense and as a tool for measurement.

## Story

Sharp and sturdy! Imagine the curved horn of a bull or a goat, used to mark territory or as a cup for drinking. This radical represents the sharp "corners" of the world and the "senses" we use to touch and perceive our surroundings. When you see it, think of an angle, a protruding point, and the direct "contact" someone makes with an object.

## Position

Standalone kanji or can appear on the left or top of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates horns, corners, angles, physical contact (touch), perception (senses), or used as a measurement of degree and position.

## Example Kanji

### 角 (horn / corner / angle)

The base kanji for a horn or a corner, used in geometry for "angles" and in daily life for the "corners" of a box or a street.

### 触 (touch / feel)

Horn (角) + insect/worm. Originally suggested an insect using its "horns" (antennae) to "touch" and sense its environment—the act of physical contact.

### 解 (untie / solve / understand)

Horn (角) + knife (刀) + cow (牛). To use a "knife" to separate the "horns" of a "cow"—the literal image of "untieing" a complex problem to reach an "understanding."
