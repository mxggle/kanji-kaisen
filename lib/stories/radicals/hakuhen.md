## Origin

A compressed version of the full 白 (white) kanji. It originally depicted the sun rising over the horizon or perhaps a bleached animal bone, capturing the essence of brilliance, purity, and absolute clarity.

## Story

Shine bright! This radical represents the color of purity, the morning sun, and the absence of shadows. When it sits on the left side of a kanji, it tells you that the meaning involves brightness, being "blank" or "clean," or the transparency of a clear truth. It brings the light of day and a sense of "untouched" beauty to any character it joins.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the color white, brightness, purity, being blank or void, or the clarity of a target or an announcement.

## Example Kanji

### 的 (target / mark / suffix)

White (白) + spoon/ladle (勺). Originally referred to the "white" center of an archery target where the marksman focused their aim.

### 皓 (clear / bright / glistening)

White (白) + announce/tell (告). Imagine the dazzling brilliance of a "clear" and "bright" light that announces itself to the world.

### 皎 (sparkling / shining / white)

White (白) + mix/intersect (交). A "sparkling," brilliant white color, like the reflection of a full moon "mixing" with the water's surface.
