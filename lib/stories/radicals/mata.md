## Origin

The mata radical is a pictograph of a right hand with three fingers outstretched. In ancient times, it was the primary form of "hand" and eventually came to mean "again" due to the constant, repetitive use of the dominant right hand.

## Story

Once more, with intent! This radical represents the tireless action of the right hand and the core concept of repetition. When you see it, think of manual labor, reaching out to grab something, and the "second time" or "additional" nature of a human action. It brings the power of the active hand and the sheer persistence of "again" to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/right of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates repetition (again, also), actions performed with the hand (grabbing, pushing), support and friendship, or the reversal of a situation.

## Example Kanji

### 又 (again / and also / or)

The base kanji for repetition and the logic of adding another fact or option to a sequence.

### 友 (friend / companion)

Right hand (又) + left hand (𠂇). Two "hands" coming together in a gesture of mutual support and help—the literal definition of a friend.

### 反 (reverse / opposite / rebel)

Cliff/slope (厂) + hand (又). To use your "hand" to push back or "reverse" your direction against a steep slope or an obstacle.
