## Origin

The samuraikanmuri radical is the "crown" form of the "samurai" (士) radical. When it sits on top of a character, it represents the authority and leading role of a scholar or warrior positioned above the rest of the kanji components.

## Story

The leader at the top! Imagine a high-ranking official or a brave samurai standing on a platform, overseeing their duties. This radical brings the energy of leadership and social status to the very head of the character. When you see it at the top, think of a voice that commands, property that is managed, or a high-ranking position.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a person of status in a leading position, formal actions, authoritative speech, or the quality of being ancient and established.

## Example Kanji

### 声 (voice / sound)

### 売 (sell)

Samurai (士) + legs/movement. Originally related to a "scholar" or official moving goods or "selling" their services; now the standard kanji for the act of selling.
