## Origin

Originally a pictograph of a snake or a worm making its way across the ground. Over time, it came to represent all small crawling and flying creatures, including insects and reptiles.

## Story

A wriggly creature moves through the grass! The top part is the head, and the body curves below. While it means 'insect' today, it covers a wide world of small wonders—from spiders and butterflies to snakes and frogs. It represents the small but vital lives that hum all around us.

Standalone kanji, on the left side (mushihen), or at the bottom

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates insects, reptiles, small crawling animals, or transformations (like a caterpillar to a butterfly)
