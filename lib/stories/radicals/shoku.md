## Origin

The shoku radical is a pictograph of a lidded vessel full of grain or food. The top part is the lid, and the bottom part represents the container holding the nourishment. It captures the essential human act of gathering and consuming food for survival.

## Story

A feast under the lid! Imagine lifting the cover of a steaming pot to find a meal prepared with care. This radical represents the energy of life—nutrition, appetite, and the domestic act of raising food. When you see it, think of the satisfaction of a full stomach and the effort required to "feed" a family or a nation.
