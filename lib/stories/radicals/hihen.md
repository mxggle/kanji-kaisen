## Origin

A compressed form of the 日 (sun) kanji. It remains a pictograph of the sun with a central dot representing its core brilliance, narrowed and flattened to fit perfectly on the left side of more complex characters.

## Story

Rise and shine! This radical brings the warmth of the sun and the steady passage of time to every kanji it joins. When you see it on the left, it tells you that the meaning involves sunlight, specific times of the day, or the bright, clear nature of the world. It is the radical of the morning, the calendar, and the absolute clarity of light.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates sunshine, daylight, time-related concepts (hours, days), brightness, clarity, or the state of the weather.

## Example Kanji

### 晴 (clear weather / sunny)

Sun (日) + blue/green/fresh (青). The weather is "sunny" and the sky is "fresh blue" because the sun is shining brightly without a cloud.

### 明 (bright / light / clear)

Sun (日) + moon (月). The two brightest objects in the sky—the sun and the moon—are shown together to represent absolute "brightness" and clarity.

### 晩 (evening / night)

Sun (日) + withdraw/exempt (免). The time of day when the "sun" finally "withdraws" and disappears over the horizon—the coming of the evening.
