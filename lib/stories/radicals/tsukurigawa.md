## Origin

The tsukurigawa radical is a pictograph of an animal hide stretched out to be tanned. The top and bottom parts represent the head and tail/rest of the hide, and the middle section shows the skin being pulled and scraped to prepare it for use. It captures the essence of raw material being transformed into durable leather.

## Story

Stretch it tight! Imagine a tough piece of animal hide being carefully prepared by a master tanner. This radical represents the transformation of nature into something protective and long-lasting—the leather used for shoes, armor, and belts. When you see it, think of durability, the smell of a tannery, and the hard "revolution" of changing a raw material into a refined product.

## Position
