## Origin

The kamikanmuri radical is a combination of the "hair" radical (長/毛) and a component representing length. It is a detailed pictograph that depicts the long, flowing hair of a person’s head.

## Story

Let your hair down! This radical represents the beauty, length, and texture of the hair on our heads. When it sits atop a character, think of personal grooming, the style of one's locks, and the cultural importance of hair as a marker of identity and health. It brings a sense of elegance, personal adornment, and the flowing grace of nature to its characters.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates hair on the head, hairstyles (beards, bangs), beauty and adornment, or the concept of things that are long and "tangled" like hair.

## Example Kanji

### 髪 (hair)

Long hair top (髟) + hand/friend (友) + hair (彡). The literal definition of the flowing "long hair" that grows upon a human head.

### 髭 (beard / mustache)

Long hair top (髟) + this (此). The specific "hair" that is located right "here" on the face—representing a beard or a mustache.

### 鬚 (beard / whiskers)

Long hair top (髟) + must/beard (須). Another variation that emphasizes the character and growth of a majestic, "necessary" beard.
