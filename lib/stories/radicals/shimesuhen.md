## Origin

The shimesuhen radical is the compressed "left side" form of the altar radical (示). It was simplified to four strokes (礻) to fit beside other components, but it retains the original meaning of a stone altar used for sacred offerings and religious rites.

## Story

A blessing on the left! When the altar "steps aside" to the left, it brings the protection of the gods to the character. Imagine the entrance to a quiet shrine where prayers are offered for "luck" and "ancestry." When you see it, think of the spiritual side of life—blessings, rituals, and the deep connection to your roots.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates divine blessings, ancestors, spirits, religious ceremonies, good luck, and anything associated with sacred rites or shrines.

## Example Kanji

### 祖 (ancestor)

Altar/gods (礻) + a stack/shelf (且). The "spirits" of those who came before you, honored and "stacked" in the family history—your "ancestors."

### 神 (god / spirit)

Altar/gods (礻) + expand/lightning (申). Represents the "expanding" power of the "spirits" or a "god" revealing themselves like a bolt of lightning.

### 福 (luck / blessing)

Altar/gods (礻) + a full jar (畐). A "blessing" where the jar (of wine or grain) on the "altar" is completely full—the true image of "good luck."
