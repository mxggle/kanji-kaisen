## Origin

The nijuuashi radical is a pictograph of two hands held together or raised up in a gesture of offering, reverence, or cooperation. It represents the strength of two people working in unison or the formal act of presenting something important to a higher authority.

## Story

Lift it up together! Imagine two hands reaching out to hold a heavy tray or join together in prayer. This radical is all about cooperation, ceremony, and the shared effort of the human experience. When you see it at the bottom of a kanji, think of an official action, a sacred offering, or the "joining" of forces to achieve a goal.

## Position

Always appears at the BOTTOM of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates cooperation, ritual offering, formal speech, or actions that require the use of both hands or a group effort.
