## Origin

The hone radical is a pictograph showing the internal structure of the human skeleton. The top part represents the skull and the joints, while the bottom part (月/肉) represents the "flesh" that encases and protects the essential "bone" within.

## Story

The foundation of the body! This radical represents the core structure, the enduring skeleton, and the hidden strength that supports us from within. When you see it, think of bones, physical frames, and the "backbone" of any situation or structure. It brings a sense of absolute structural integrity, deep-seated substance, and the "bare bones" truth to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or on the left side of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical bones, the skeleton, core structures, the essence or "marrow" of a thing, or the concept of durability and strength.
