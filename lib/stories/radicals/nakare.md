## Origin

The nakare radical is a variation of the "mother" radical (母). It originally depicted a woman with two dots representing breasts, but with an additional horizontal line through the center. This line acted as a "cancel" or "prohibition" sign, changing the meaning from "mother" to "do not" or "must not."

## Story

Stop! A strong line is drawn through the center of this character, telling you to halt or cease. While it looks like a mother, that extra stroke turns it into a command of prohibition. When you see this radical, think of a boundary that cannot be crossed or an action that must not be taken. It’s the radical of limits and caution.

## Position

Usually appears as a central component or at the bottom of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates prohibition, negation ("do not"), or related concepts of maternal care and the boundaries within a family.

## Example Kanji

### 母 (mother)

The base form representing a mother nursing a child, the symbol of nurturing, care, and the origin of life.

### 毎 (every)

Person (人) + mother/not (母 variant). Originally related to a plant growing or a mother "regularly" tending to things, leading to the meaning of frequency or "every."

### 毒 (poison)

Plant (生) + mother/not (母 variant). This refers to a "mother plant" that has grown wild or bitter, becoming "not" good to eat—a dangerous poison.
