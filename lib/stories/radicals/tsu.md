## Origin

The tsu radical consists of three small marks at the top of a character that resemble the Katakana character "tsu" (ツ). It is a simplified version of more complex ancient forms representing light, sparks, or the roof of a decorative building.

## Story

Three sparks at the top! Imagine three small flickers of light or raindrops falling onto the roof of a house. This radical represents small, intense points of focus. When you see it at the very top of a character, think of the "sparks" of a strict discipline, the busy energy of management, or the simple "unit" that makes up a larger whole.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates small parts, intense focus, light rays/sparks, strictness, or provides the structural "crown" for characters related to management and simplicity.

## Example Kanji

### 単 (single / simple)

Tsu crown (⺍) + a field + a box. Originally suggested a "single" weapon or tool with multiple points, now used for things that are "simple" or "individual."

### 営 (manage / build)

Tsu crown (⺍) + two boxes (口) + cloth/bottom. Represents the busy, "sparking" activity of "managing" a large building or running a business office.

### 厳 (strict / severe)

Tsu crown (⺍) + cliff/rock + dare. A "severe" and "strict" attitude, as intense as "sparks" flying from a "cliff" or a difficult task.
