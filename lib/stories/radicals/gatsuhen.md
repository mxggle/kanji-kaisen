## Origin

A compressed form of the 歹 (death) radical. It represents a broken bone or remnants of life, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of characters that involve mortality, ruin, and the physical transitions of the body.

## Story

The silence of the grave! This radical brings a powerful sense of finality and the somber reality of death to its characters. When it sits on the left, think of the tragic end of a story, the ruthless nature of time, and the physical remnants that stay behind. It is the radical of the mourning ritual, the ancient battlefield, and the philosopher who contemplates the temporary nature of all things.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates death and passing, being ruthless or cruel, leftover fragments or remains, the process of decay, and the conceptual state of being "unfortunate."

## Example Kanji

### 残 (remain / ruthless / rest / balance)

Death (歹) + two/level (戔/二). It originally related to the "remains" on a battlefield after a conflict—now used for what "remains" or is left over in any situation.

### 殊 (special / unique / particularly)

Death (歹) + cinnabar/pill (朱). Originally a "special" type of capital punishment—now evolved to mean anything that is "particularly" unique or out of the ordinary.

### 殖 (multiply / increase / augment)

Death (歹) + upright/straight (直). To take something that was dead or decaying (like compost) and use it to "multiply" and increase the fertility of the land.
