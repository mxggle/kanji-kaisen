## Origin

The ushihen radical is the narrowed "left side" form of the cow radical (牛). The bottom horizontal stroke is slanted upward (slanted cow) to fit beside the other components, but it retains its original meaning as a symbol of sturdy livestock and physical material.

## Story

The provider on the left! When the "cow" moves to the side, it sets the stage for characters related to physical "things" and the "sacrifice" required for sacred rites. Imagine a cow being led to a market or a shrine. It represents the "material" world—the objects we touch, the animals we raise, and the "special" status of something chosen for a purpose.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical objects (things), specific types of animals, sacrifice, special status, or the concept of materials and livestock.
