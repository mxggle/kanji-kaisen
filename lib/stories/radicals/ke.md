## Origin

The ke radical is a pictograph showing the long, whiskery hair of an animal or the fine, soft strands of human fur. It captures the natural texture and growth of hair in its various biological forms.

## Story

A fuzzy feeling! This radical represents the natural covering of animals and the fine, organic details of human growth. When you see it, think of warmth (fur), texture (bristles), and the raw material for ancient cloth and scholar's brushes. It brings a sense of softness, organic detail, and the tactile nature of life to any character it joins.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical hair, fur, whiskers, bristles, or objects made from these materials (like brushes, tails, or woolen cloth).

## Example Kanji

### 毛 (hair / fur / bristle / down)

The base kanji for the growth of hair on animal skin or the fine, protective down of a young bird.

Body (尸) + hair (毛). The specific part of an animal's "body" that is covered in "hair" and used for balance—the literal definition of a tail.

### 筆 (brush / writing tool)

Bamboo (竹) + hair (聿/毛). A traditional writing tool made from a sturdy "bamboo" handle and animal "hair" for the bristles—the fundamental tool of the scholar.
