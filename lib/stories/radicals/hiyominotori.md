## Origin

The hiyominotori radical is a pictograph of an ancient wine jar or a vessel used for fermentation. Over time, it also became the symbol for the tenth sign of the Chinese zodiac (the rooster/bird), which was associated with the "west" and the sunset.

## Story

Cheers to the harvest! This radical represents the ancient jars of fermented wine and the bounty of the ripened earth. When you see it, think of things that have "aged" or "mellowed" like a fine wine, or the specific time transition of the zodiac. It brings the richness of tradition and the deep, fermented wisdom of time to any character it joins.

## Position

Usually appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates alcoholic drinks (sake, wine), fermentation, aging or ripening, the west (sunset), or celebratory/social gatherings involving drink.
