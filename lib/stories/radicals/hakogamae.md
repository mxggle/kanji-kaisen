## Origin

The hakogamae radical is a pictograph of a container or a sturdy box seen from the side with one open end. It represents a functional space designed to store, organize, or hide precious objects from view.

## Story

Put it safely in the box! This radical represents a container designed to keep its contents secure and out of the way. When you see it "wrapping" around a character, think of storage, secrecy, and the boundaries that define a private space. It is the radical of the treasure chest, the archive, and the hidden detail.

## Position

Wraps around the central component of the kanji from the top, bottom, and left (forming a box open to the right).

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates containers (boxes, chests), the act of hiding or concealing, craftsmanship (making boxes), or being enclosed within a specific limit.
