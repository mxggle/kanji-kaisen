## Origin

The gen radical is a combination of a "person" (人) and a horizontal line above the head (二). In its earliest form, it was meant to point specifically to the "top" of a person's head—the most important part of the body, the source of thought and life.

## Story

Everything starts at the top! This radical points to the head, the source, and the very beginning of all things. When you see it, think of foundations, primary causes, and the "original" state of the world. It is the radical of the "first" and the "essential," capturing the moment before everything else follows.

## Position

Usually appears as a standalone kanji or at the bottom/center of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates beginning, origin, the human head, foundations, or something of primary importance.
