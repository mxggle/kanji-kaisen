## Origin

The kuraberu radical is a pictograph of two people standing side by side, facing the same direction. It represents the primal act of placing two objects together to see their similarities, differences, and relative value.

## Story

How do they measure up? This radical represents the universal human habit of comparing things to find the most beautiful, the strongest, or the most useful. When you see it, think of ranking, matching, and the meticulous process of evaluating worth by looking at two sides of a coin. It brings a sense of proportion, competition, and careful, side-by-side observation to all its characters.

## Position

Often appears as a standalone kanji or at the top/right of complex characters.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates comparison, lining things up in order, matching pairs, competition, or the conceptual act of "measuring" one thing against another.

## Example Kanji
