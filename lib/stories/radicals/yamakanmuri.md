## Origin

The yamakanmuri radical is the "crown" form of the mountain radical (山). It represents the same three peaks rising from the earth, but it is positioned at the top of a character to show that the concept below is related to the height, the coast, or the majesty of the peaks.

## Story

The peak at the top! Imagine the jagged summit of a great mountain overlooking the shore. This radical brings the energy of physical "height" and the "obstacles" of the landscape to a kanji. When you see it at the top, think of the "rocky" edge of a coast, the "islands" rising from the sea, and the "majestic" presence of a mountain guarding the land.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates mountains, height, coasts (where mountains meet the sea), cliffs, rocky terrain, islands, or concepts of majesty and rugged beauty.

## Example Kanji

### 岸 (shore / coast / bank)

Mountain (山) + cliff + dry/shield. The "shore" or "coast" where the "mountains" and "cliffs" meet the water—a rugged and "dry" boundary.

### 島 (island)

Mountain (山) + bird + mountain variant. Originally showed a "bird" resting on a "mountain" rising out of the sea—the literal image of an "island."

### 岩 (rock / boulder)

Mountain (山) + stone (石). The "stones" found high up on a "mountain"—the standard kanji for a large "rock" or boulder.
