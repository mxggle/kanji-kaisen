## Origin

The nishi radical is a pictograph of a woven cover or a canopy used to shield something from above. It eventually became associated with the "west" (西) because the sun "covers" itself or hides behind the horizon in that direction at the end of the day.

## Story

Spread the canopy! This radical represents a protective layer or a lid that wraps over the top of a character. When you see it, think of a shielding cover, a containment, or the direction where the sun goes to rest. It brings a sense of enclosure and the finality of sunset to the characters it joins.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates a cover, a lid, a state of being contained, or the geographical direction of the west.

## Example Kanji

### 要 (important / summarize)

Cover (襾) + woman (女). Originally represented a woman's belt or "cover" for the waist, eventually evolving to mean something "essential" or "important" that holds things together.

### 票 (ballot / slip)

Cover (襾) + fire (示 variant). Originally suggested bits of sparks or ash "covered" and rising from a fire, now used for slips of paper or ballots.

### 覆 (cover / capsize)

Cover (襾) + return/repeat (復 variant). The act of throwing a "cover" over something to hide it, or the sudden "tipping over" (capsizing) of a vessel.
