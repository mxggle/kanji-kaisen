## Origin

A compressed form of the 糸 (thread) kanji. It depicts a bundle of fine silk threads twisted together, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of a character while representing the strength and continuity of woven material.

## Story

Weaving the world together! This radical represents the threads, strings, and ropes that bind objects, people, and ideas across time. When it sits on the left, think of textiles, manufacturing, deep connections, and the continuity of life's experiences. It is the radical of the master weaver, the long-term relationship, and the fine, interconnected details that make up the fabric of reality.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates textiles (cloth, fabrics), tying or binding things together, continuity and connection, fine work/manufacturing, or the concept of a "line" or "string."

## Example Kanji

### 結 (tie / knot / conclude)

Thread (糸) + auspicious/good (吉). To "tie" together "good" intentions or literal threads to form a lasting "knot" or a successful conclusion to an event.

### 線 (line / wire / beam)

Thread (糸) + spring/source (泉). A continuous "thread" that flows and stretches like water from a pure "spring"—representing a long, fine line or wire.

### 練 (practice / refine / train)

Thread (糸) + separate/select (柬). To carefully "separate" and "refine" raw "threads" through steady work until they are perfectly smooth, strong, and prepared.
