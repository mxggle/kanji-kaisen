## Origin

A compressed form of the 火 (fire) kanji. It depicts rising flames and sparks jumping from a roaring bonfire, narrowed to fit on the left side of a character while retaining the energy of a blazing heat.

## Story

Careful, it’s hot! This radical brings the heat, energy, and transformative power of fire to its characters. When it sits on the left side, think of burning, cooking, artificial light, or an intense passion that glows like a torch. It is the radical of the forge, the hearth, and the spark of creation that changes everything it touches.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical fire, heat, the process of burning or cooking, light sources (lamps), or intense emotions and energy.

## Example Kanji

### 焼 (bake / grill / burn)

Fire (火) + lofty/high (尭). Imagine the high, lofty flames of a professional oven used to "bake" bread or "grill" food to a perfect crisp.

### 灯 (light / lamp / torch)

Fire (火) + nail/stake (丁). A single, focused "nail" of "fire"—representing the steady, small flame of a lamp or a guiding torch.

### 燃 (burn / ignite / blaze)

Fire (火) + natural/as it is (然). To apply "fire" to something that is already in its natural state of being ready to catch light—to ignite and blaze up.
