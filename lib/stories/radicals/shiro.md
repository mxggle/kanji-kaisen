## Origin

The shiro radical is a pictograph of a sun rising above the horizon (the single dot at the top), casting a clear, bright light. It represents the color of pure light, cleanliness, and the clarity of a blank surface.

## Story

Pure as the morning light! Imagine the very first ray of sun clearing the darkness, leaving everything bright and white. This radical represents honesty, purity, and the beginning of a clear path. When you see it, think of a blank sheet of paper, a cloudless sky, or the innocence of something untouched and new.

## Position

Standalone kanji or can appear at the top, bottom, or left of a character.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates the color white, purity, innocence, clarity, truth (speaking openly), or the concept of a blank state or a target.

## Example Kanji

### 白 (white)

The base kanji for the color white, used to describe anything from snow to the "white" of a person's eye or skin.

### 百 (hundred)

One (一) + white (白). While its origins are complex, it suggests "one" massive number that is as bright and clear as "white"—the number one hundred.

### 的 (target / -ish)

White (白) + spoon/ladle. Represents a bright "white" mark (like a bullseye) that one aims for—now used for "targets" and as a suffix meaning "characteristic of."
