## Origin

A compressed form of the 金 (gold) kanji. It depicts the furnace and the extracted nuggets of metalcraft, narrowed specifically to fit on the left side of characters that involve transaction, tools, and the minerals of the earth.

## Story

Forge the future! This radical represents the practical, hardworking side of metal—the sharp blades, resonant bells, and sturdy machinery that literally shape our modern world. When it sits on the left, it tells you that the meaning involves physical tools, hard minerals, or the specialized "worth" of metallic objects. It is the radical of the master blacksmith, the jeweler's craft, and the engineer's vision.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates physical tools (knives, needles), various metals (silver, iron, copper), minerals, machinery, and the trade and market value of metal goods.

## Example Kanji

### 鉄 (iron / steel)

Metal (金) + lost (失). It originally referred to a metal that was so common and useful it could be "lost" or used liberally compared to rare gold—iron.

### 銀 (silver / bank)

Metal (金) + limit/boundary (艮). A prestigious metal that sits "next" to gold and marks the distinct "boundary" of luxury—now the root of the word for "bank."

### 銅 (copper / bronze)

Metal (金) + the same (同). A versatile metal that has been used for the "same" essential purposes as iron or bronze throughout the ages—representing copper.
