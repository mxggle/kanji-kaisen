## Origin

A highly compressed and simplified form of the 衣 (clothes) radical. It represents the same concept of robes and garments but is designed specifically to fit on the left side of complex kanji characters.

## Story

Wear your story! This radical brings the world of tailoring, fashion, and social roles to its characters. When it sits on the left, think of the specific items of clothing we use (sleeves, pockets, shirts), the processes of garment-making, and the symbolic "layers" that define our place in society. It is the radical of the tailor's shop, the dresser's mirror, and the public image.

## Position

Always appears on the LEFT side of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates specific clothing items, tailoring and sewing, repairing garments, abundance (plenty of clothes), and the social status associated with dress.

## Example Kanji

### 袖 (sleeve)

Clothes (衤) + go through/pass (由). The specific part of the "clothes" that the arm "passes through" to reach the outside world—a sleeve.

### 補 (supplement / repair / assist)

Clothes (衤) + big/begin (甫). To "repair" and "supplement" a piece of "clothing" that has been damaged—representing any act of assistance or fixing.

### 裕 (abundant / rich / fertile)

Clothes (衤) + valley/mouth (谷). To have "clothes" that are as wide, loose, and "abundant" as a deep "valley"—the historical symbol of richness and ease.
