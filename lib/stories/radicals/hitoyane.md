## Origin

The hitoyane radical is a variation of the "person" radical (人) used specifically at the top of a kanji. Its slanted shape looks like a simple roof, suggesting a person sheltering under a structure or people gathering together in one place.

## Story

Shelter under the roof! This radical looks like a person spreading their arms wide or a simple roof over a home. It represents protection, the household, and the "top" of our shared experience. When it sits atop a character, think of people gathering together under one roof, or the protective boundaries that define a shared space and common purpose.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates people gathering together, protection (like a roof), the concept of "now" (being under the current point in time), or a shared community.

## Example Kanji

### 今 (now / present)

Person roof (𠆢) + a line. It originally referred to a person being directly "under" a specific, immediate point in time—meaning right "now."

### 会 (meeting / assembly / meet)

Person roof (𠆢) + clouds/gathering. Imagine many diverse people gathering "under one roof"—the literal definition of a "meeting" or an "assembly."

### 傘 (umbrella)

Person roof (𠆢) + multiple people (人人) + a stem. A clear pictograph of an "umbrella"—a portable "roof" carried by a person to stay dry in the rain.
