## Origin

The yokome radical is a flattened, "horizontal" (yoko) form of the eye radical (目). It represents the same pictograph of a human eye with its pupil and lids, but it was reshaped to sit on top of other components, often representing a watchful eye or a "net" used to capture truth or criminals.

## Story

Watch from above! Imagine an eye turned on its side to peer down from the roof of a building. This radical is the spirit of "supervision," "judgment," and the "net" that captures those who break the law. When you see it at the top, think of an official "station," the "sin" that is observed, and the "punishment" delivered by a watchful authority.

## Position

Always appears at the TOP of the kanji.

## Transforms Meaning

Indicates eyes, watching/supervision, judgment, legal networks (nets), official stations, sins, or the concept of an observing presence from above.

## Example Kanji

### 署 (public-service station)

Eye crown (罒) + person + sun/field. A "station" where "people" work under a "watchful eye" to serve the public—like a police or fire station.

### 罪 (sin / crime / guilt)

Eye/net (罒) + wrong/not. Imagine someone being caught in a "net" for doing something "wrong"—the literal image of a "sin" or crime.

### 買 (buy)

Eye/net (罒) + shell/money (貝). Originally suggested "shells" (money) being "watched" or gathered in a "net"—the act of purchasing or "buying."
