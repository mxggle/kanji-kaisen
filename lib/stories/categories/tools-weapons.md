## Description

These radicals represent the tools humans use—from agricultural implements to weapons, containers to vehicles. They reflect humanity's ingenuity in solving problems and surviving.

## Why It Matters

Tool radicals help you understand kanji about making things, cutting, measuring, and technology. The 刂 (rittou - knife radical) appears in many kanji about cutting or dividing. 車 (kuruma - wheel/cart) relates to vehicles and transportation.

## Learning Tip

Tool radicals often suggest what the kanji 'does.' 刂 (knife) means cutting or separating. 弓 (bow) relates to shooting or bending. 斤 (axe) indicates chopping or weight. Think about what action the tool performs.

- **刂 (rittou)** - knife radical means cutting or dividing
