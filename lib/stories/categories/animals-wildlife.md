## Description

These radicals depict animals from everyday life—dogs, horses, fish, birds, and insects. Ancient people observed these creatures and found ways to represent their essential characteristics.

## Why It Matters

Animal radicals appear in kanji about specific animals, animal behaviors, and metaphors derived from animal traits. The 犭 (kemonohen - animal radical) appears in many creature-related kanji. Understanding these helps with nature vocabulary.

## Learning Tip

Many animal radicals were originally pictographs. 馬 (horse) shows the head, mane, and legs. 魚 (fish) depicts a fish with scales and tail. 鳥 (bird) shows feathers and claws. Look for the original animal shapes!

## Common Patterns

- **犭 (kemonohen)** - beast radical indicates four-legged animals
- **鳥 (tori)** - bird radical means flying creatures
- **魚 (uo)** - fish radical relates to aquatic life
- **虫 (mushi)** - insect radical includes bugs and small creatures
