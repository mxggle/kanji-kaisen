## Description

These radicals depict parts of the human body, human figures, and relationships between people. From 人 (person) to 心 (heart/mind), these symbols connect us to the most intimate aspects of being human.

## Why It Matters

Human-related radicals appear in kanji about emotions, actions, relationships, and society. The 亻(ninben - person radical) alone appears in over 100 common kanji! Understanding 心 (heart) radicals helps you read emotional vocabulary.

## Learning Tip

Notice how body parts often become simplified when used as radicals. 人 becomes 亻 on the left side, 手 becomes 扌, and 心 becomes 忄. Learning these transformations is key to recognizing radicals in context.

## Common Patterns

- **亻 (ninben)** - person on the left indicates human actions or qualities
- **扌 (tehen)** - hand radical means touching, making, or manipulating
- **目 (me)** - eye radical relates to seeing, watching, or appearance
- **口 (kuchi)** - mouth radical connects to speaking, eating, or openings
