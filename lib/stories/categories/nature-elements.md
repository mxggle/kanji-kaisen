## Description

These radicals represent the fundamental elements of the natural world—water, fire, earth, wood, mountains, and celestial bodies. Ancient Chinese scholars observed nature closely and created symbols that captured the essence of each element.

## Why It Matters

Nature radicals are among the most common in Japanese kanji. Understanding them unlocks hundreds of characters related to weather, geography, materials, and natural phenomena. When you see 氵(water), 火 (fire), or 木 (tree/wood), you'll immediately have a clue about the kanji's meaning.

## Learning Tip

Many nature radicals evolved from pictographs. Try to see the original image: 山 looks like three mountain peaks, 川 shows flowing water, and 火 depicts flames rising. Visualizing these connections makes them unforgettable.

## Common Patterns

- **氵 (sanzui)** - water radical on the left means liquid, flowing, or wet
- **火/灬 (hi/rekka)** - fire radical indicates heat, burning, or cooking
- **木 (ki)** - tree radical relates to wood, plants, or organic things
- **土 (tsuchi)** - earth radical connects to ground, place, or construction
