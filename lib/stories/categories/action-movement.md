## Description

These radicals capture the essence of movement, action, and transformation. From walking (辶) to stopping (止), they represent the dynamic nature of life and change.

## Why It Matters

Action radicals are essential for understanding verbs and describing what people do. The 辶 (shinnyou - movement radical) appears in many common kanji like 道 (way), 進 (advance), and 運 (carry). Mastering these unlocks action vocabulary.

## Learning Tip

Many action radicals show feet or legs in motion. 辶 (shinnyou) sweeps along the bottom like a path being walked. 走 (run) shows a person with moving legs. Imagine the motion to remember them.

## Common Patterns

- **辶 (shinnyou)** - movement radical indicates traveling or paths
- **止 (tomeru)** - stop radical means halting or footsteps
- **力 (chikara)** - power radical relates to strength or effort
- **彳 (gyouninben)** - step radical indicates walking or streets
