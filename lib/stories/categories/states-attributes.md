## Description

These radicals describe states of being, colors, sizes, and qualities. They help us express what things are like—big or small, colored or plain, good or bad.

## Why It Matters

State radicals are crucial for adjectives and descriptions. Understanding 大 (big), 小 (small), 長 (long), and color radicals helps you build descriptive vocabulary. These radicals often form the core meaning of the kanji they appear in.

## Learning Tip

Many state radicals are standalone kanji too. 大 means 'big' as a kanji and as a radical. 赤 means 'red' both ways. When you learn these radicals, you're often learning kanji simultaneously!

## Common Patterns

- **大 (dai)** - big radical means large or great
- **小 (shou)** - small radical indicates tiny or few
- **白 (shiro)** - white radical relates to blank or pure
- **青 (ao)** - blue/green radical indicates young or fresh
