## Description

These radicals represent buildings, roofs, enclosures, and the spaces humans create. From the roof radical 宀 to the gate 門, they show how we shape our environment.

## Why It Matters

Structure radicals help you understand kanji about buildings, rooms, safety, and civilization. When you see 宀 (roof) on top of a character, you know it relates to houses, protection, or what's inside. 門 (gate) indicates entrances or barriers.

## Learning Tip

Structure radicals often 'contain' other elements, just like real buildings contain things. The 囗 (kunigamae - enclosure) literally wraps around other components. Think of radicals as the 'container' and inner parts as 'contents.'

## Common Patterns

- **宀 (ukanmuri)** - roof radical means houses, protection, or family
- **門 (mongamae)** - gate radical indicates entrances or barriers
- **广 (madare)** - cliff/building radical relates to structures
- **囗 (kunigamae)** - enclosure radical means surrounded or contained
