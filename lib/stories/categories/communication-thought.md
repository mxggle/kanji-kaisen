## Description

These radicals capture the human capacity for thought, speech, and communication. From 言 (words) to 心 (heart/mind), they represent our inner world and how we share it.

## Why It Matters

Communication radicals are essential for vocabulary about speaking, thinking, reading, and writing. The 言 (gonben - speech radical) appears in verbs like 話す (talk), 読む (read), and 語る (tell). These are fundamental for language learning.

## Learning Tip

訁(gonben) is the simplified form of 言 used on the left side of kanji. When you see it, think 'words' or 'language.' Similarly, 心 (and its variants 忄 and ⺗) all relate to emotions and thoughts.

## Common Patterns

- **訁/言 (gonben)** - speech radical means words, language, or telling
- **心/忄 (kokoro)** - heart radical relates to emotions and thoughts
- **見 (miru)** - see radical indicates observing or appearance
- **音 (oto)** - sound radical means noise or music
