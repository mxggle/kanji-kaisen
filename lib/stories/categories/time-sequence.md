## Description

These radicals mark time, order, and sequence. From celestial bodies that early humans used to track days to symbols of beginning and ending, they connect us to time's passage.

## Why It Matters

Time radicals help you understand kanji about when things happen. 日 (sun/day) appears in days of the week and time expressions. 月 (moon/month) relates to months and periods. These are essential for calendars and schedules.

## Learning Tip

日 (sun/day) and 月 (moon/month) are among the first kanji taught because they're so fundamental. Notice that 月 also appears as the 'flesh/body' radical (月 nikuzuki) in body-related kanji—context tells you which meaning applies.

## Common Patterns

- **日 (hi/nichi)** - sun radical means day, time, or sunlight
- **月 (tsuki)** - moon radical indicates month or period
- **夕 (yuube)** - evening radical means night or twilight
- **十 (juu)** - ten radical relates to numbers and completion
